This section outlines the **core mechanics**, gameplay systems, and the foundational rules that drive the game experience. Each element is crafted to ensure an immersive, cooperative gameplay experience that balances challenge, progression, and reward for both characters, Leo and Vinny.

---

## **Core Mechanics**

1. **Dual Gameplay in Cooperative Campaign**  
   - The **core mode** of the game is a **cooperative campaign** that requires two players to control Leo and Vinny.  
   - Players collaborate to solve puzzles, bypass security systems, and complete heist objectives through synchronized gameplay.  

2. **Stealth and Physical Infiltration (Leo)**  
   - Leo’s mechanics emphasize stealth and physical traversal:
     - **Movement:** Crouching, sprinting, climbing, and parkour maneuvers.  
     - **Visibility System:** Guards’ vision cones and dynamic shadows determine detection risk.  
     - **Noise Mechanics:** Actions like running or knocking over objects can alert nearby guards.  

3. **Hacking and Puzzle Mechanics (Vinny)**  
   - Vinny operates remotely through a 2D cyberspace interface:
     - **Firewalls and Defenses:** Players solve puzzles to disable alarms, open locked doors, or disrupt guard patrols.  
     - **Multitasking:** Vinny must manage time-sensitive tasks while Leo navigates physical threats.  
     - **Tool Upgrades:** New tools unlock as missions progress, allowing more advanced system manipulation.  

4. **Synchronization and Teamwork**  
   - Players must communicate and coordinate effectively:
     - **Example:** Vinny disables cameras and laser grids in real time as Leo sneaks through.  
     - **Fail State:** If either player is caught or fails a task, the mission resets to the last checkpoint.

## **Gameplay Modes**

1. **Cooperative Campaign (Primary Mode)**  
   - A story-driven experience where Leo and Vinny work together to infiltrate high-security locations.  
   - The campaign features:
     - **Shared Objectives:** Both players must contribute to complete each mission.  
     - **Progression:** Players unlock new tools and abilities for Leo and Vinny.  

2. **Solo Campaign (Optional)**  
   - For single-player gameplay, the AI controls the secondary character:
     - Players can issue commands to the AI to perform specific tasks.  

3. **Speedrun Mode**  
   - A competitive mode for experienced players:
     - Leaderboards track completion times.  
     - Includes time-based objectives and optional challenges.

## **Player Objectives**

1. **Primary Goals**  
   - Complete high-stakes heists by:
     - Extracting sensitive data from corporate servers.  
     - Sabotaging critical systems.  
     - Collecting evidence against corrupt organizations.  

2. **Secondary Goals**  
   - Optional challenges reward risk-taking:
     - Access hidden areas for bonus items or lore.  
     - Complete missions without being detected.  
     - Achieve time-based milestones in Speedrun Mode.

## **Rules and Systems**

### 1. **Firewalls and Network Security (Vinny)**  
   - Hacking puzzles simulate real-world cybersecurity challenges:
     - **Firewalls:** Sequential logic puzzles requiring precision and timing.  
     - **Encryption:** Players must decipher patterns to bypass secure systems.  
     - **Server Overload:** Resource management to avoid triggering alarms.  

### 2. **Anti-Hacking Measures (Vinny)**  
   - Defenses escalate as missions progress:
     - **Dynamic Firewalls:** Adjust puzzles based on player behavior.  
     - **Failsafes:** Incorrect puzzle inputs activate security measures.  

### 3. **Security Bots and Environmental Hazards (Leo)**  
   - **Patrolling Security Bots:** React dynamically to noise or movement.  
   - **Environmental Hazards:** Laser grids, pressure-sensitive floors, and motion-activated cameras.  

### 4. **Active Defenses Impacting Both Players**  
   - Alarms and failed hacks have consequences for both players:
     - **Leo’s World:** Increased guard patrols and tightened security.  
     - **Vinny’s World:** Puzzles become more complex and time-sensitive.

## **Progression and Pacing**

1. **Skill Unlocks**  
   - Players gradually unlock new abilities and tools:
     - **Leo:** Quieter movement, EMP devices, and grappling hooks.  
     - **Vinny:** Faster decryption, advanced hacking tools, and access to restricted systems.  

2. **Mission Structure**  
   - Early missions serve as tutorials for core mechanics, while later missions require intricate teamwork.  
   - Levels grow in complexity with overlapping objectives and security systems.  

3. **Level Design**  
   - Each level is designed for cooperative synergy:
     - **Leo:** Navigates physical obstacles and stealth scenarios.  
     - **Vinny:** Operates remotely to open paths and disable threats.

## **Challenges and Difficulty**

1. **Dynamic Difficulty**  
   - Systems adapt to player performance:
     - Struggling players encounter simpler puzzles or slower guards.  
     - High-performing players face tougher AI and faster challenges.  

2. **Time Pressure**  
   - Certain objectives are time-sensitive:
     - Example: Vinny must disable a system before Leo triggers an alarm.  

3. **Adaptive Guard AI**  
   - Guards react dynamically to player behavior, making repetitive strategies less effective.

## **Items and Rewards**

1. **Consumables**  
   - **Leo:** Smoke bombs, EMP devices, and decoys to distract guards.  
   - **Vinny:** Overclock tokens that temporarily speed up hacking tasks.  

2. **Permanent Upgrades**  
   - **Leo:** Enhanced agility, quieter movement, and better equipment.  
   - **Vinny:** Faster hacking speeds and access to more advanced systems.  

3. **Cosmetic Rewards**  
   - Players unlock unique outfits and themes for completing optional challenges.  

4. **Story Rewards**
