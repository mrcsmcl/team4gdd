# Core Mechanics

- Stealth: For the 3D player, movement involves stealth, avoiding AI guards, and assisting the 2D player by interacting with obstacles.
- Puzzles: For both players, puzzle-solving mechanics will be critical. The 2D player will be navigating a digital space, possibly resembling platformer-like puzzles, while the 3D player has environmental puzzles in the physical world.
- Co-op Interactions: Both players must help each other progress, using voice or chat, with the 3D player potentially moving the 2D player through obstacles or unlocking areas by solving real-world puzzles.
- Time Pressure: The game has a speedrun element, where both players must race against the clock to complete objectives and escape the building.


# Gameplay Mode

In the 2D gameplay mode, the player starts with a simple map and limited access to the environment's systems. Initially, the 2D player can only suggest directions to the 3D player without knowing what lies ahead. As they solve puzzles and hack into the system, new features are unlocked: first, they gain access to security cameras, which allow them to see the environment in real time, including the 3D player and any enemies. With this strategic view, the 2D player can then guide the 3D player on safer paths to avoid encounters.

As they progress, the 2D player gains access to additional tools, such as controlling doors, opening alternative routes, and even intercepting the guards' communications. This way, they can anticipate enemy movements and create distractions if necessary. This system includes multiple screens â€“ one for the map, another for hacking puzzles, and one for the cameras.

# Player Objectives

- Escape from a corporate building while freeing one of the characters from the mainframe.
- Work cooperatively in a split 3D/2D world to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles.

# Rules and Systems

Each level contains a combination of stealth challenges for the 3D player and puzzle-platformer challenges for the 2D player.

# Progression and Pacing

# Challenges and Difficulty

- Stealth mechanics for the 3D player will involve timing, hiding, and strategy to avoid AI guards.
- The 2D player will face timed puzzle sequences that affect both characters.
