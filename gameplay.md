# Core Mechanics

- Stealth: The 3D player must navigate the physical environment stealthily, avoiding detection by AI guards and security systems. This includes using cover, timing movements, and coordinating with the 2D player to disable obstacles or distract guards.
- Puzzles: Both players engage in puzzle-solving, each in their respective worlds. The 2D player encounters platformer-like puzzles within the digital space, while the 3D player tackles environmental puzzles in the physical world, such as activating devices or bypassing locked areas.
- Co-op Interactions: The players rely on real-time communication, either through voice or chat. The 3D player can physically interact with the environment to support the 2D player's progression, and the 2D player uses system hacks to provide crucial intel and unlock paths.
- Time Pressure: Speed is essential, as each level is timed, pushing both players to complete objectives quickly. The players’ performance can be graded, and high scores or fast completion times can unlock rewards, encouraging replayability and speedrunning.

## 2D Gameplay Mode

In the 2D mode, the player begins with limited access to the facility’s systems, armed with only a basic map that allows them to suggest directions to the 3D player. As the 2D player progresses through puzzles and hacks deeper into the system, they unlock essential tools to aid the 3D player:

- Security Camera Access: The 2D player can access live feeds from security cameras, allowing them to see the 3D player’s location in real time and spot any nearby enemies. With this surveillance ability, the 2D player can direct the 3D player safely around the environment.
- Control Over Facility Systems: As the 2D player gains access to more parts of the system, they can control doors, open alternative routes, and even intercept enemy communications. This allows the 2D player to influence the environment, creating distractions, opening secure paths, and triggering system malfunctions to assist the 3D player.
- Multi-Screen Interface: The 2D player operates across several displays—one for the facility map, another for hacking puzzles, and a third for live camera feeds. The 2D player must monitor these screens and prioritize tasks based on the 3D player’s situation and needs.


## 3D Gameplay Mode

In the 3D mode, the player navigates the physical environment and must rely on stealth and agility to avoid guards, bypass obstacles, and reach mission objectives. The 3D player’s actions are tightly integrated with the 2D player’s hacking abilities, making coordination essential. Key aspects of the 3D gameplay include:

- Stealth and Evasion: The 3D player is primarily focused on stealth. They must avoid detection by guards and cameras, which have different movement patterns and detection ranges. Guards may also have varying alert levels, requiring the 3D player to study patrol routes and time their movements carefully. If the 3D player is spotted, they may have a brief window to hide or escape to avoid triggering alarms.
- Physical Obstacles and Environmental Interaction: The 3D player encounters locked doors, security barriers, and other obstacles that they can’t bypass alone. They often need the 2D player to hack into systems to unlock these areas or disable alarms temporarily. The 3D player can also interact with certain objects, such as keypads or terminals, that allow them to assist the 2D player by unlocking additional access points in the digital space.
- Communication and Cooperation: To navigate safely, the 3D player relies heavily on instructions from the 2D player, who can see guard positions via camera feeds. The 3D player must remain in constant communication to receive guidance on safe routes, upcoming dangers, or areas with valuable resources. This real-time communication is essential for successfully bypassing enemy patrols and solving environment-based puzzles.
- Timed Sequences and Quick Decision-Making: Certain sections introduce timed challenges, where the 3D player must quickly follow the 2D player’s instructions to bypass newly alerted guards, open secure doors within a limited window, or navigate through areas with heightened security measures. These sequences test both players’ quick-thinking and coordination skills, adding a layer of urgency.

# Player Objectives

- Escape the Facility: The primary objective is to escape the corporate building, coordinating between both characters to avoid detection and overcome security challenges.
- Free the 2D Character: The 2D character, initially trapped within the mainframe, must gain enough access to manifest in the physical world and join the 3D player at the extraction point.
- Cooperative Problem-Solving: Players must work in tandem to solve puzzles that blend their unique perspectives and capabilities, building toward a successful escape.

# Rules and Systems

The game incorporates advanced IT security measures that act as dynamic obstacles to both players. These systems not only prevent unauthorized access but also actively counteract the 2D player’s hacking attempts and interfere with the 3D player’s progress. Key systems include:

## Firewalls and Network Security

- Layered Firewalls: As the 2D player hacks deeper into the facility’s systems, they encounter increasingly complex firewalls that restrict access to critical areas, such as security camera feeds or control over doors. These firewalls require the 2D player to solve timed puzzles or complete multi-step hacking sequences to bypass each layer successfully.
- Adaptive Firewalls: Certain high-security sections have adaptive firewalls that change patterns or “lock down” periodically, requiring the 2D player to rethink their approach to gain access. This adds an element of unpredictability, where a solution that worked once may need to be modified or re-attempted after the firewall adjusts.

## Anti-Hacking Measures

- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS): If the 2D player’s actions become too frequent or aggressive, the building’s IDS activates, tracking unauthorized digital movement and alerting IT security bots that begin countering the hacks. These bots can block access to security cameras, disable previously unlocked doors, or reset progress on certain hacks, forcing the 2D player to act more strategically and time their hacks carefully.
- Counter-Hack Attempts: When certain areas are compromised, the system automatically initiates counter-hack attempts to undo the 2D player’s progress. For instance, if the 2D player gains control over a door system, the counter-hack system will start a countdown timer to reclaim control, challenging the 2D player to keep control or find an alternative route before time runs out.

## Security Bots and Digital Defenses

- Security Bots: Security bots patrol digital sections of the mainframe, seeking out and blocking unauthorized access paths. They can temporarily disable the 2D player’s controls, lock certain map sections, or even redirect the player to a previous area, slowing progress and creating additional challenges. The 2D player must navigate carefully, using stealth tactics to avoid detection by these bots.
- Virus Scans and Forced Reboots: At specific intervals, the system initiates virus scans, which threaten to force the 2D player out of the mainframe temporarily. If caught in a scan, the player’s access is “rebooted,” causing them to lose recent progress and requiring them to re-access certain tools or camera views. The 2D player must avoid these scans or time their hacks to stay undetected.

## Active Defenses Impacting Both Players

- Alarm and Lockdown Protocols: If the 3D player is spotted by guards or cameras, alarms are triggered, causing specific areas to go into lockdown. This raises barriers, re-routes patrols, and restricts access to key locations. To deactivate the alarm, the 2D player must quickly navigate to an override terminal in the system, giving the 3D player a chance to escape before backup guards arrive.
- Defensive Power Surges: In high-security areas, the system can activate power surges that temporarily disable electronic systems, including the 2D player’s access to cameras and control over doors. These power surges also create momentary distractions, allowing the 3D player a chance to sneak past enemies but also forcing them to move quickly before systems come back online.

# Progression and Pacing

The game’s difficulty scales as players progress, with each level introducing more complex puzzles, additional enemy types, and upgraded tools for the 2D player. The pacing balances tense stealth sequences with problem-solving breaks, fostering a rhythm that maintains engagement.

- Early Levels: These serve as an introduction, familiarizing players with basic controls, mechanics, and cooperative strategies.
- Intermediate Levels: Mid-game levels increase complexity by adding new security types, environmental hazards, and multi-step puzzles that require precise timing and teamwork.
- Final Levels: The climax features high-intensity, high-stakes situations where both players must use all unlocked abilities in tandem to outwit the AI and reach the extraction point.

# Challenges and Difficulty

- 3D Player Stealth Challenges: The 3D player must time movements carefully, using hiding spots and cover to avoid guards’ line of sight. Some guards may have unique detection patterns or heightened senses, increasing the difficulty.
- 2D Player Puzzle Challenges: The 2D player faces increasingly complex puzzles that involve multi-stage hacking, coordination with the 3D player, and timed sequences. The digital space may feature “firewalls” or other obstacles that require creative solutions.

# Items and Rewards

- Unlockable Abilities: Progression rewards include new hacking capabilities for the 2D player and improved stealth gear for the 3D player. Examples include temporary invisibility for the 3D player or a “priority hack” option for the 2D player to disable multiple systems at once.
- Speedrun Medals: Completing levels quickly and efficiently can earn players medals or badges, which may unlock special content or leaderboard placement.
- In-Game Collectibles: Players can find hidden data fragments or lore items that expand the game’s backstory and provide minor gameplay bonuses, such as brief boosts to the 2D player’s hacking energy or short cooldown reductions for the 3D player’s gadgets.
