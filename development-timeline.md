# Production Plan and Details

This plan accounts for a smaller development team, extending timelines to ensure quality while balancing the team’s workload. It includes detailed phases, tasks, and milestones, spread over a realistic schedule.

---

**Total Duration:** ~24-30 months, with flexibility for iteration and unforeseen challenges.

---

## **Pre-Production (2-3 Months)**

- **Concept Development**  
  - Finalize an extensive game design document covering narrative, mechanics, systems, and art direction.  
  - Conduct research to refine the story, character development, and gameplay flow.  

- **Prototyping**  
  - Create proof-of-concept prototypes for:
    - 3D gameplay (Leo’s movement, stealth mechanics).  
    - 2D hacking interface and interactions (Vinny’s gameplay).  
  - Test and refine based on feedback.  

- **Art Direction**  
  - Develop style guides for environments, characters, UI, and visual effects.  
  - Establish a consistent mood for diverse locations, from suburban homes to corporate offices.

## **Production**  
### **Phase 1: Core Systems Development (6-8 Months)**

1. **Core Gameplay Implementation**  
   - Develop core systems for:
     - Player movement, including stealth mechanics (Leo).  
     - Hacking and puzzle systems (Vinny).  
   - Build a working inventory and interaction system for both characters.  

2. **Environment Development**  
   - Begin creating modular assets for each location:  
     - Suburban house, café, warehouse, Neotech headquarters.  
   - Block out and iterate on level layouts, ensuring smooth gameplay progression.  

3. **AI and Gameplay Systems**  
   - Develop basic AI systems for guards, including patrol routes and alert mechanics.  
   - Create environmental hazards (cameras, motion sensors, alarms).  

4. **Placeholder Assets**  
   - Produce temporary assets for early testing, such as characters, props, and environmental elements.  

---

### **Phase 2: Content Creation and Polish (10-12 Months)**

1. **Expanded Level Design**  
   - Finalize layouts for all levels, including unique spaces like maintenance tunnels and security offices.  
   - Add interactive elements, puzzles, and story-related objects.  

2. **Art and Animation**  
   - Replace placeholders with polished 3D models, textures, and animations.  
   - Develop detailed character models for Leo, Vinny, and NPCs.  

3. **Advanced AI**  
   - Enhance guard behaviors with dynamic responses to player actions.  
   - Add unique NPC interactions based on their roles (e.g., tech workers, security personnel).  

4. **Sound and Voice Implementation**  
   - Integrate finalized soundtrack, sound effects, and voiceovers into the game.  

5. **UI/UX Enhancements**  
   - Develop and polish user interfaces for hacking, inventory management, and mission tracking.  
   - Refine tutorials and player guidance systems.  

---

### **Phase 3: Testing and Final Polish (6-8 Months)**

1. **Extensive Playtesting**  
   - Conduct multiple rounds of testing, focusing on mechanics, pacing, and balance.  
   - Collect feedback from external testers to identify pain points and areas for improvement.  

2. **Optimization**  
   - Enhance game performance across all target platforms.  
   - Optimize AI and environmental interactions to prevent bugs.  

3. **Final Adjustments**  
   - Refine visuals, animations, and effects for a cohesive aesthetic.  
   - Address all major and minor issues uncovered during testing.  

---

## **Post-Production (3-4 Months)**

1. **Final Debugging and Polishing**  
   - Ensure all gameplay elements function smoothly without crashes or performance dips.  

2. **Marketing and Promotion**  
   - Create promotional materials, including gameplay trailers and key art.  
   - Develop a community engagement strategy, such as social media campaigns and pre-launch events.  

3. **Launch and Post-Launch Support**  
   - Release the game on targeted platforms.  
   - Monitor feedback and release patches or updates as needed.  

---

## **Key Milestones**

1. **Concept Approval (End of Pre-Production)**  
   - Game design document and prototypes showcasing key mechanics.  

2. **Alpha Build (End of Phase 1)**  
   - Playable version featuring core gameplay mechanics and basic environments.  

3. **Beta Build (End of Phase 2)**  
   - Feature-complete build with finalized assets, polished systems, and balanced gameplay.  

4. **Release Candidate (End of Phase 3)**  
   - Ready-to-launch build incorporating feedback from playtesting.  

5. **Launch**  
   - Official release of the game on chosen platforms.
