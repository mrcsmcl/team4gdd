# Resilio Sync Setup for Game Development Collaboration

## What is Resilio Sync?

Resilio Sync is a peer-to-peer file synchronization tool that facilitates fast, secure, and reliable sharing of files across multiple devices. For this game development project, Resilio Sync will be used to share important resources like recorded videos, edited images, and other media, ensuring that all team members can access and contribute to the shared files effortlessly.

## Shared Folders and Their Purpose

Below is a list of folders that will be synchronized using Resilio Sync, with a description of their intended use. Each folder will have a unique sync code (to be added later):
