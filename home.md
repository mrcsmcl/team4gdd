# High Concept

A cooperative game for two players blending stealth, puzzles, and strategic communication. One player explores a highly detailed 3D map, while the other controls a minimalist computer system, providing real-time remote support. The synergy between players is essential to overcome challenges, avoid enemies, and complete objectives.

# Genre

- Co-op Stealth
- Puzzle-solving
- Hacking Simulation and Tactical Exploration

# Platforms

- PC (Windows)

# Target Audience

The game targets:
- Players aged 16 to 35 seeking innovative cooperative experiences.
- Enthusiasts of stealth games like *Hitman*, *Splinter Cell*, or *Deus Ex*.
- Players who enjoy communication-based challenges and real-time problem-solving.
- Fans of minimalist sci-fi aesthetics and realistic futuristic atmospheres.

# Visual Style

- **3D Environment:**  
Clean and futuristic architecture inspired by *Mirror's Edge Catalyst*, with a high-tech twist. A color palette dominated by whites, grays, and vibrant accents of red and blue to highlight interactive elements. A tense, sterile atmosphere with realistic lighting enhancing the sense of danger and urgency. High-tech security, featuring patrolling drones, smart cameras, and automated doors.  

- **Computational Interface (2D):**  
Minimalistic, inspired by operating systems like classic Linux and Windows. Sober colors like green, black, and gray. A command terminal, interactive maps, and camera interfaces simulate real-world hacking systems.  

# Inspirations

- **Games:**  
  - *Mirror's Edge Catalyst* (map design and movement fluidity).  
  - *Superhot* (stylized aesthetics and tension).  
  - *Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes* (cooperation and communication).  
  - *Hacknet* (realistic hacking simulation).  

- **Movies and Series:**  
  - *Mr. Robot* (hackers and tense atmospheres).  
  - *Inception* (creative use of environments and puzzles).  

# Game Summary

In this cooperative game  two players must work together to complete high-risk missions. The player in the 3D world must navigate stealthily through futuristic environments, avoiding enemies and overcoming physical barriers. The player in the 2D system provides remote support by unlocking doors, disabling cameras, and supplying crucial information. Communication and synergy between the two players are critical for success.

The narrative follows two main characters, Vinny and Leo, on missions against corrupt corporations and authoritarian systems. Each mission presents unique challenges, including puzzles requiring precise synchronization between both players.
