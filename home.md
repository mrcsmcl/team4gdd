# High Concept

A futuristic co-op stealth escape game where two characters—one navigating the physical world and the other infiltrating the digital systems—must work together to escape a high-security facility. As they progress, each character unlocks critical abilities essential for overcoming obstacles and avoiding detection.

# Genre

- Co-op Puzzle Stealth Game (with Speedrun Elements)

# Platforms

- PC (Windows)

# Target Audience

- Players aged 16-35
- Fans of puzzle games, stealth mechanics, and futuristic settings
- Gamers interested in cooperative gameplay and speedrunning challenges
- Fans of asymmetrical gameplay (2D and 3D perspectives)

# Visual Style

- 3D Player World: A sleek, futuristic environment with high-tech security systems, advanced architecture, and a tense, sterile atmosphere.
- 2D Player World: A minimalist, pixelated or grid-based digital world with vibrant colors representing data streams, nodes, and obstacles within the network.

# Inspirations

- Portal 2 (for cooperative puzzle-solving)
- Mark of the Ninja (for stealth mechanics)
- Superhot (for time-based gameplay and puzzle action)
- Mirror’s Edge Catalyst (for futuristic architecture and movement)

# Game Summary

In a high-tech futuristic world, two operatives team up to escape a high-security facility. One player controls the 3D character navigating the physical space, evading guards and unlocking paths, while the other player infiltrates the facility’s digital systems in a 2D interface. The 2D player starts with limited access, only able to suggest directions to the 3D player. As they solve puzzles and hack into deeper system levels, they gain new abilities, including real-time camera access, door controls, and the ability to intercept guard communications. This allows the 2D player to guide the 3D player safely through the environment, avoiding detection and unlocking alternative routes.
