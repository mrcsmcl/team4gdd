# Chapter 01

## Scene 1 - The Garage Conversation

**Int. Suburban House Garage – Night**  
A simple space, cluttered with tech: old monitors, disassembled computer parts, tangled cables. **VINNY** (nerdy, early twenties, with intense, restless eyes) is working on an old Linux terminal, while **LEO** (twenty-one, athletic, always with headphones) paces back and forth, holding a controller in his hands.

> **LEO**  
> *(impatient)*  
> Dude, have you seen the **NEXUS 9000**? It’s the dream console! Immersive graphics, AI that learns from the player, an infinite library. It’s everywhere.

> **VINNY**  
> *(sarcastic)*  
> And with a price tag only the rich can afford, right? Just looking at the ad makes my wallet hurt.

> **LEO**  
> *(laughing)*  
> Yeah, I know... And you know I can’t afford even a fraction of that. I barely managed to pay for my last headset upgrade. *(pause, eyes lighting up)* What if... we just got one, you know?

> **VINNY**  
> *(raising an eyebrow, intrigued)*  
> Got one? What do you mean, “got one”? This is a console, not some two-dollar game on sale.

> **LEO**  
> *(lowering his voice, more serious)*  
> We can do it, Vinny. Look, I’ve been to that store like ten times. I know the layout. What if we did a test run first? Like… simulate it here at your place to see if we can actually pull it off.

> **VINNY**  
> *(surprised but interested)*  
> You’re serious, huh? A simulation... here?

> **LEO**  
> *(nodding, smiling)*  
> Exactly! You’ll be in control, monitoring everything from the terminal. It’s just a training run, no risk... but if we make it through, that **NEXUS 9000** store is our next target.

---

## Scene 2 - Preparing for the Run

**Int. Garage – Night**  
**VINNY** gets up from his chair, looking around the cluttered garage thoughtfully. **LEO** watches, excited, already mentally ready for action.

> **VINNY**  
> *(thoughtful)*  
> Okay, let’s say I’m in. How do you plan to turn my place into a “high-tech console store”?

> **LEO**  
> *(grinning)*  
> Easy! *(glances around, pointing at cameras and monitors)* You already have most of what we need right here. I’ll come in through the garage, and you control the cameras and guide me. If I can get past the “security system” without getting caught… then I think we’re ready for the next level.

> **VINNY**  
> *(chuckling)*  
> So the idea is you’re the “thief” and I’m the hacker on standby?

> **LEO**  
> *(nodding confidently)*  
> Exactly! You’ll monitor, redirect cameras, disable alarms… like in real-time. And I’ll do the “physical” work, you know, what I’m good at.

> **VINNY**  
> *(sighing, smiling)*  
> Alright, you convinced me. Let’s see if your plan holds up. I’ll set up the system here. But if it fails, that’s on you.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, confident)*  
> If I fail, I swear I’ll pay for your next system upgrade. But hey, that’s not happening!

---

**Int. Control Room – Minutes later**  
**VINNY**’s computer screen now displays multiple windows, code scrolling on the terminal, cameras connected, each one showing a different angle of the house. He adjusts the system, creating virtual barriers and simulated “blind spots.”

**LEO** dons a black hoodie and takes position by the garage door, waiting for **VINNY**’s signal.

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking through the headset)*  
> All set. Go ahead, “thief,” show me what you’ve got.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering, stepping out of the garage)*  
> That console is as good as ours.

**VINNY** watches the cameras closely, guiding LEO through the space, dodging simulated sensors, moving the cameras via terminal commands. **LEO** moves carefully, crouching, making his way through each corner as if in a real store.

---

## Scene 3 - The Return to the Garage

**Int. Garage – Moments later**  
**LEO** walks back into the garage, laughing and out of breath, a satisfied glint in his eyes. **VINNY** waits by the monitor, arms crossed, unable to hide his grin.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, excited)*  
> That was awesome! I got past all the “traps” you set up. And you managing the cameras? Felt like something straight out of a movie.

> **VINNY**  
> *(feigning modesty)*  
> It wasn’t that hard. But I gotta admit... you did well. *(pauses, thinking)* If this was just a test, I think we’re ready for something bigger.

> **LEO**  
> *(playfully punching Vinny’s shoulder, pumped up)*  
> Then it’s settled. Our next target: a real store. And this time, we’re walking out with a NEXUS 9000!

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at the terminal, thoughtful yet excited)*  
> Let’s get to planning, then. We’ll need details... and a lot of patience.

# Chapter 02

## Scene 1 - The Planning

**Int. Living Room – Morning**  
The environment is calm, but the tension in the air is palpable. **VINNY** is sitting at the table, with several screens in front of him, open to maps, documents, and security websites. **LEO**, wearing the same hood, walks through the room holding a coffee cup, observing everything attentively. They are more serious now.

> **LEO**  
> *(drinking the coffee, thoughtful)*  
> Ok, the simulation was easy, but this is a big-league game. The store is real. They have security cameras, alarms, and even a surveillance system that doesn’t mess around.

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling, focused)*  
> I know, I know… But that’s why we’re here. The plan needs to be meticulous. We can’t leave anything to chance. *(points to the monitor)* I’ve already done the research. This store has a well-protected main entrance, but there’s a small back entrance that’s deserted at night.

> **LEO**  
> *(following Vinny’s finger on the screen)*  
> And the security? How are we going to deal with that?

> **VINNY**  
> *(serious, eyes still on the screen)*  
> This is where the fun part comes in. I’ll hack the security camera system. We managed to manipulate their network. You’ll enter from the back and do your part. I’ll cover you.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, determined)*  
> I’ll do the heavy lifting then. Get in, grab the console, and get out without being seen. While you stay in charge. No mistakes this time.

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at Leo, with a spark in his eyes)*  
> No mistakes. And please, no heroics. We don’t want to draw attention.

---

## Scene 2 - The Unexpected Invasion

**Int. Electronics Store – Night**  
The store is dark and silent, with shelves full of new gadgets, including the coveted NEXUS 9000. The light from the stars enters through the window and reflects off the glass. **LEO** sneaks in through the back door, crouched, holding a backpack. He looks around, ensuring he’s alone. On the headset, **VINNY**’s voice whispers calmly from the other side.

> **VINNY**  
> *(soft voice through the headset)*  
> All good so far, Leo. Cameras disabled in the entrance area. You have the green light.

> **LEO**  
> *(softly, looking around)*  
> Alright, I’ll go straight to the back of the store and grab the NEXUS 9000. Watch out for the alarms, ok?

> **VINNY**  
> *(calm, focused on the screen)*  
> Don’t worry. No alarms for now. Everything under control.

**LEO** moves forward, skillfully navigating the shelves and racks, avoiding the sensor and camera zones that **VINNY** adjusted. He finally reaches the shelf where the console is displayed. He smiles when he sees the NEXUS 9000, shining under the dim light.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling to himself)*  
> This is the prize, my friend.

> **VINNY**  
> *(through the headset, suspicious)*  
> Stay alert, Leo. Something’s not right… I felt a shift in the system. Something moved in the security circuits.

> **LEO**  
> *(worried)*  
> What? No way…

Suddenly, footsteps echo through the store. **LEO** freezes in place, his eyes widening as he sees a figure approaching. A security guard, in uniform and holding a flashlight, walks past the shelves. **LEO** presses himself against the wall, breathing slowly.  

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking quickly, panic starting to rise in his voice)*  
> Damn, there’s someone there! You didn’t tell me there was security at night!

> **LEO**  
> *(low, heart racing)*  
> I… I didn’t know! He wasn’t in the security scheme!

> **VINNY**  
> *(annoyed, running through the controls)*  
> Damn it, Leo, he must have control of the alarm system. I need to disable it before he triggers anything.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering, trying to move without being seen)*  
> Then hurry, quick. I’ll stay here and try not to make a sound.

---

## Scene 3 - The Cat and Mouse Game

The tension rises. The guard passes again, slower this time, stopping near the shelf where **LEO** is hiding. He sees nothing, but the air is thick, and **LEO** can almost hear his own heartbeat.

> **VINNY**  
> *(panicking, typing on the terminal)*  
> Just one more second… I’m almost there to make him lose the alarm signal.

> **LEO**  
> *(breathing deeply, nervous)*  
> I don’t know how much longer I can stay here, man. He’s too close!

The guard passes again, but now **LEO**’s focus is on a window he notices in the back, right next to the alarm system.

> **LEO**  
> *(urgent, almost whispering)*  
> Hey, I’m going to try the window. If I run there, maybe I can disable the system in time.

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking quickly)*  
> Hold tight! Don’t do anything risky, just let me know when you’re there.

**LEO** starts moving slowly, with almost inaudible steps, until he reaches the window. He uses his stealth skills to not make a single sound. The guard is now on the opposite side of the store, checking the security cameras.  

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering into the headset)*  
> I’m getting to the window… just let me know if he’s close.

> **VINNY**  
> *(urgent)*  
> You’re almost there… just one more second… Now… ready! The system’s lost! He won’t have control over anything anymore!

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, relieved)*  
> Good! Now, let’s get out of here.

---

## Scene 4 - The Quick Exit

**LEO** runs silently toward the back door, his backpack now full of the NEXUS 9000. He glances over his shoulder, seeing the guard slowly walking away. The tension is at its peak, but he finally reaches the door, unlocks it, and steps out onto the street.

> **VINNY**  
> *(relaxed, but with a hint of relief)*  
> We did it, damn! I thought it was going to go wrong.

> **LEO**  
> *(laughing, taking a deep breath)*  
> It was close. But the console is ours! On to the next, my friend.

---

# Chapter 03

## Scene 1 - A New Plan

**Int. Living Room – Day**  
**LEO** and **VINNY** are on the couch, playing together on the *NEXUS 9000*, which now takes the prominent spot in the room. Their excitement is evident as they exchange laughs and teasing while playing.

> **LEO**  
> *(laughing while playing)*  
> Dude, check this out! This graph is insane. Totally worth every second of the scare from yesterday.

> **VINNY**  
> *(shrugging, with a satisfied smile)*  
> Yeah... I admit, it was risky, but now that it worked out, the adrenaline was worth it.

> **LEO**  
> *(thoughtfully, pausing the game)*  
> We made it, Vinny. And it was a store, you know? Even with the guard, we got out fine. Imagine what else we could do...

> **VINNY**  
> *(pretending indifference, but curious)*  
> Like what? You’re not telling me you’re already thinking of another “brilliant plan,” are you?

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, a glint in his eyes)*  
> I don’t know, what if it’s something a bit bigger? Something that would really pay off...

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at Leo with a mix of concern and excitement)*  
> Wait a minute... Are you serious? We’ve already got the console! Isn’t that enough?

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, excited)*  
> I know, but... after yesterday, it feels like we’ve got the hang of it. And if we do it right, there’s no reason to stop now, right?

---

## Scene 2 - The New Decision

**Int. Living Room – Day - A little later**  
**LEO** gets up from the couch, pacing back and forth, clearly excited about the idea. **VINNY** still hesitates but begins to see **LEO**'s growing enthusiasm, which starts to convince him.

> **LEO**  
> *(determined)*  
> Think about it... Next time, we pick a more strategic place, maybe somewhere where the security system isn’t so tough. We just need a target... somewhere the money or the items are worth the risk.

> **VINNY**  
> *(still cautious, but convinced)*  
> Alright, maybe. But no small stores. If we’re doing this, it’s going to be something bigger, with planning and no mistakes.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, satisfied)*  
> That’s the spirit! No amateur stuff. This time, we’ll do a real job.

---

## Scene 3 - Researching the Target

**Int. Vinny's Room - Night**  
**VINNY** is sitting at the computer, browsing websites and discreetly researching potential targets. He scrolls through event listings and local news, looking for something that catches his eye. **LEO** is next to him, watching closely.

> **LEO**  
> *(speaking quietly, thoughtful)*  
> It could be something with an easy security system to bypass... an electronics shop? Or somewhere we can get more than just a console...

> **VINNY**  
> *(staring at the screen)*  
> If we want something valuable, we need a place where the profit is high. Look at this... *(he points to the screen)* This warehouse from a tech store, it has stock of parts and new equipment.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, excited)*  
> Perfect! New equipment, advanced technology... and easy profit for those who know what to grab.

> **VINNY**  
> *(still unsure)*  
> But it’s a warehouse. The security is probably tougher than a regular store. What if the place has complex alarms?

> **LEO**  
> *(confident)*  
> That’s why you’re here, Vinny. You’ll be able to neutralize any system. We just need to study a bit more and... it’s done.

> **VINNY**  
> *(giving in, convinced)*  
> Alright, let’s go for it. But this time, no mistakes. I’ll start mapping out the security and see what I can do.

> **LEO**  
> *(patting Vinny’s shoulder, excited)*  
> That’s what I like to hear, partner! We’re going far.

---

## Scene 4 - Preparing the Plan

**Ext. Warehouse - Night**  
**LEO** and **VINNY** park the car on a deserted side street, with a good view of the warehouse. They watch the building from a distance, lit by some exterior lights and protected by an electronic gate.

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at the tablet, confident)*  
> Okay, first, let’s shut down the external camera system. Looks like they’re using an old system, shouldn’t be a problem.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, adjusting his mask)*  
> Easy, just let me know when I can go in.

> **VINNY**  
> *(typing quickly)*  
> Give me a minute... done, external cameras are off. No eyes on the gates. Go ahead.

> **LEO**  
> *(grabbing his backpack)*  
> Great. Keep me posted.

**VINNY** stays in the car, with the tablet on his lap and the laptop open beside him, while **LEO** approaches the warehouse, using the shadows to hide. **VINNY** starts accessing the internal camera system, typing commands quickly in the terminal.

---

## Scene 5 - An Unexpected Barrier

**Int. Warehouse - Entrance**  
**LEO** enters quietly through the blind spot identified by **VINNY**. He moves slowly through the poorly lit corridors, hearing only the distant sound of some equipment running.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering through the earpiece)*  
> I'm inside. How's it looking out there?

> **VINNY**  
> *(focused on the screens)*  
> All under control so far. The external cameras are down, but the internal surveillance is still active. Give me a minute...

While **VINNY** types quickly, the tablet suddenly shows an alert that appears as a pop-up window: "UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. LOCKDOWN IN PROGRESS."  

> **VINNY**  
> *(confused, typing frantically)*  
> Wait... What is this? No, this wasn’t in the system. They have something here that wasn’t in the plans...

A red light flashes on the screen, and the connection to the internal cameras is cut off, leaving **VINNY** in a panic.  

> **VINNY**  
> *(with a tense voice)*  
> Leo, something's wrong. I can't access the internal cameras. The security system detected a motion-triggered lockdown, and the firewall has been activated.

> **LEO**  
> *(stopping, looking around)*  
> Firewall? It was supposed to be an old system... Now I’m blind in here!

> **VINNY**  
> *(trying to stay calm, but already concerned)*  
> They must have a hidden backup system... Give me a second, I'll try to bypass this.

> **LEO**  
> *(crouching behind a shelf, impatient)*  
> I don't know how much time we have, Vinny. I can't see anything in here, and this place is a maze.

> **VINNY**  
> *(taking quick notes)*  
> Ok... main system, disabled. But there’s a subnet. I’ll try to hack that! The connection is limited, but not lost.

While **VINNY** works, **LEO** begins to realize that the alarm is closer than he thought. The light from a motion sensor in the back lights up. The countdown appears on **VINNY**'s tablet.  

> **VINNY**  
> *(focusing on the laptop screen)*  
> Just a few more seconds, Leo. I’ve breached the secondary network! I’ll try to disable the alarm manually. They won’t wait much longer, but... damn, we still have a shot.

The tension builds as **VINNY**'s tablet begins to show the countdown: "ALARM ACTIVATED. COUNTDOWN: 2 MINUTES."  

> **LEO**  
> *(urgently, in panic)*  
> Vinny, you have to hurry! I’m inside, but the police are coming, there’s no time left! Guards are walking around here!

> **VINNY**  
> *(desperately, typing quickly)*  
> I’m trying! I’m unlocking the system... almost there!

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering, moving to another section)*  
> I don’t have much time, the alarm’s sound will go off soon! Tell me you're close!

> **VINNY**  
> *(breathlessly, typing the commands)*  
> No time for mistakes, Leo... almost...!

On the laptop screen, **VINNY** types in a final command and presses "Enter." The tablet light flashes, and the connection to the security system is restored.  

> **VINNY**  
> *(relieved, but exhausted)*  
> I did it! The cameras are back online, and the alarm’s been deactivated. The police won’t be called... for now.

> **LEO**  
> *(relieved, laughing nervously)*  
> For now?! Are you crazy, Vinny?! You almost gave me a heart attack! And hey, I’m still in here!

> **VINNY**  
> *(calming down, but focused on the screens)*  
> I told you it would work, man. Now go! Grab what you need and get out, fast!

---

## Scene 6 - The Risky Choice

**Int. Warehouse - Technology Section**  
**LEO** runs to the technology section, dodging guards, finding boxes with various devices. He grabs some smaller items, putting them in the backpack quickly. Meanwhile, **VINNY** is in the car, trying to regain access to the system to ensure nothing else goes wrong.

> **LEO**  
> *(nervously smiling)*  
> Okay, okay, give me a second here, I’m grabbing some things... I’m already leaving.

> **VINNY**  
> *(scared)*  
> Get out of there now, Leo! The alarm was about to go off, and we still don’t know how many more guards are around here! Come on, hurry up!

> **LEO**  
> *(shouting through the earpiece)*  
> Calm down! Just a little longer! I’m not leaving empty-handed!

---

## Scene 7 - The Escape

**Ext. Warehouse - Street**  
**LEO** quickly escapes through the same entrance he came in, running to the car where **VINNY** has already started the engine. They speed off quickly, turning the corner to avoid the approaching patrols. Both are out of breath, but relieved to have escaped by a narrow margin.

> **LEO**  
> *(nervously smiling)*  
> Man, we almost screwed up back there, huh? That was close!

> **VINNY**  
> *(staring at Leo, irritated, but with a nervous smile)*  
> That was too much! But what matters is we made it. Just don’t do that again, okay?

> **LEO**  
> *(shrugging, with a confident smile)*  
> Oh, but look what we’ve got here... *(opens the backpack, showing the items)* ...worth it, right?

> **VINNY**  
> *(reluctantly, but smiling)*  
> You're an idiot, Leo. But in the end, you're an idiot who knows what he's doing.

Both laugh as the car disappears into the night, leaving the warehouse behind.
