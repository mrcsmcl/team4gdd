# Chapter 01

## Scene 1 - The Garage Conversation

**Int. Suburban House Garage – Night**  
A simple space, cluttered with tech: old monitors, disassembled computer parts, tangled cables. **VINNY** (nerdy, early twenties, with intense, restless eyes) is working on an old Linux terminal, while **LEO** (twenty-one, athletic, always with headphones) paces back and forth, holding a controller in his hands.

> **LEO**  
> *(impatient)*  
> Dude, have you seen the **NEXUS 9000**? It’s the dream console! Immersive graphics, AI that learns from the player, an infinite library. It’s everywhere.

> **VINNY**  
> *(sarcastic)*  
> And with a price tag only the rich can afford, right? Just looking at the ad makes my wallet hurt.

> **LEO**  
> *(laughing)*  
> Yeah, I know... And you know I can’t afford even a fraction of that. I barely managed to pay for my last headset upgrade. *(pause, eyes lighting up)* What if... we just got one, you know?

> **VINNY**  
> *(raising an eyebrow, intrigued)*  
> Got one? What do you mean, “got one”? This is a console, not some two-dollar game on sale.

> **LEO**  
> *(lowering his voice, more serious)*  
> We can do it, Vinny. Look, I’ve been to that store like ten times. I know the layout. What if we did a test run first? Like… simulate it here at your place to see if we can actually pull it off.

> **VINNY**  
> *(surprised but interested)*  
> You’re serious, huh? A simulation... here?

> **LEO**  
> *(nodding, smiling)*  
> Exactly! You’ll be in control, monitoring everything from the terminal. It’s just a training run, no risk... but if we make it through, that **NEXUS 9000** store is our next target.

---

## Scene 2 - Preparing for the Run

**Int. Garage – Night**  
**VINNY** gets up from his chair, looking around the cluttered garage thoughtfully. **LEO** watches, excited, already mentally ready for action.

> **VINNY**  
> *(thoughtful)*  
> Okay, let’s say I’m in. How do you plan to turn my place into a “high-tech console store”?

> **LEO**  
> *(grinning)*  
> Easy! *(glances around, pointing at cameras and monitors)* You already have most of what we need right here. I’ll come in through the garage, and you control the cameras and guide me. If I can get past the “security system” without getting caught… then I think we’re ready for the next level.

> **VINNY**  
> *(chuckling)*  
> So the idea is you’re the “thief” and I’m the hacker on standby?

> **LEO**  
> *(nodding confidently)*  
> Exactly! You’ll monitor, redirect cameras, disable alarms… like in real-time. And I’ll do the “physical” work, you know, what I’m good at.

> **VINNY**  
> *(sighing, smiling)*  
> Alright, you convinced me. Let’s see if your plan holds up. I’ll set up the system here. But if it fails, that’s on you.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, confident)*  
> If I fail, I swear I’ll pay for your next system upgrade. But hey, that’s not happening!

---

**Int. Control Room – Minutes later**  
**VINNY**’s computer screen now displays multiple windows, code scrolling on the terminal, cameras connected, each one showing a different angle of the house. He adjusts the system, creating virtual barriers and simulated “blind spots.”

**LEO** dons a black hoodie and takes position by the garage door, waiting for **VINNY**’s signal.

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking through the headset)*  
> All set. Go ahead, “thief,” show me what you’ve got.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering, stepping out of the garage)*  
> That console is as good as ours.

**VINNY** watches the cameras closely, guiding LEO through the space, dodging simulated sensors, moving the cameras via terminal commands. **LEO** moves carefully, crouching, making his way through each corner as if in a real store.

---

## Scene 3 - The Return to the Garage

**Int. Garage – Moments later**  
**LEO** walks back into the garage, laughing and out of breath, a satisfied glint in his eyes. **VINNY** waits by the monitor, arms crossed, unable to hide his grin.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, excited)*  
> That was awesome! I got past all the “traps” you set up. And you managing the cameras? Felt like something straight out of a movie.

> **VINNY**  
> *(feigning modesty)*  
> It wasn’t that hard. But I gotta admit... you did well. *(pauses, thinking)* If this was just a test, I think we’re ready for something bigger.

> **LEO**  
> *(playfully punching Vinny’s shoulder, pumped up)*  
> Then it’s settled. Our next target: a real store. And this time, we’re walking out with a NEXUS 9000!

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at the terminal, thoughtful yet excited)*  
> Let’s get to planning, then. We’ll need details... and a lot of patience.

---

# Chapter 02

## Scene 1 - The Planning

**Int. Living Room – Morning**  
The environment is calm, but the tension in the air is palpable. **VINNY** is sitting at the table, with several screens in front of him, open to maps, documents, and security websites. **LEO**, wearing the same hood, walks through the room holding a coffee cup, observing everything attentively. They are more serious now.

> **LEO**  
> *(drinking the coffee, thoughtful)*  
> Ok, the simulation was easy, but this is a big-league game. The store is real. They have security cameras, alarms, and even a surveillance system that doesn’t mess around.

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling, focused)*  
> I know, I know… But that’s why we’re here. The plan needs to be meticulous. We can’t leave anything to chance. *(points to the monitor)* I’ve already done the research. This store has a well-protected main entrance, but there’s a small back entrance that’s deserted at night.

> **LEO**  
> *(following Vinny’s finger on the screen)*  
> And the security? How are we going to deal with that?

> **VINNY**  
> *(serious, eyes still on the screen)*  
> This is where the fun part comes in. I’ll hack the security camera system. We managed to manipulate their network. You’ll enter from the back and do your part. I’ll cover you.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, determined)*  
> I’ll do the heavy lifting then. Get in, grab the console, and get out without being seen. While you stay in charge. No mistakes this time.

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at Leo, with a spark in his eyes)*  
> No mistakes. And please, no heroics. We don’t want to draw attention.

---

## Scene 2 - The Unexpected Invasion

**Int. Electronics Store – Night**  
The store is dark and silent, with shelves full of new gadgets, including the coveted NEXUS 9000. The light from the stars enters through the window and reflects off the glass. **LEO** sneaks in through the back door, crouched, holding a backpack. He looks around, ensuring he’s alone. On the headset, **VINNY**’s voice whispers calmly from the other side.

> **VINNY**  
> *(soft voice through the headset)*  
> All good so far, Leo. Cameras disabled in the entrance area. You have the green light.

> **LEO**  
> *(softly, looking around)*  
> Alright, I’ll go straight to the back of the store and grab the NEXUS 9000. Watch out for the alarms, ok?

> **VINNY**  
> *(calm, focused on the screen)*  
> Don’t worry. No alarms for now. Everything under control.

**LEO** moves forward, skillfully navigating the shelves and racks, avoiding the sensor and camera zones that **VINNY** adjusted. He finally reaches the shelf where the console is displayed. He smiles when he sees the NEXUS 9000, shining under the dim light.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling to himself)*  
> This is the prize, my friend.

> **VINNY**  
> *(through the headset, suspicious)*  
> Stay alert, Leo. Something’s not right… I felt a shift in the system. Something moved in the security circuits.

> **LEO**  
> *(worried)*  
> What? No way…

Suddenly, footsteps echo through the store. **LEO** freezes in place, his eyes widening as he sees a figure approaching. A security guard, in uniform and holding a flashlight, walks past the shelves. **LEO** presses himself against the wall, breathing slowly.  

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking quickly, panic starting to rise in his voice)*  
> Damn, there’s someone there! You didn’t tell me there was security at night!

> **LEO**  
> *(low, heart racing)*  
> I… I didn’t know! He wasn’t in the security scheme!

> **VINNY**  
> *(annoyed, running through the controls)*  
> Damn it, Leo, he must have control of the alarm system. I need to disable it before he triggers anything.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering, trying to move without being seen)*  
> Then hurry, quick. I’ll stay here and try not to make a sound.

---

## Scene 3 - The Cat and Mouse Game

The tension rises. The guard passes again, slower this time, stopping near the shelf where **LEO** is hiding. He sees nothing, but the air is thick, and **LEO** can almost hear his own heartbeat.

> **VINNY**  
> *(panicking, typing on the terminal)*  
> Just one more second… I’m almost there to make him lose the alarm signal.

> **LEO**  
> *(breathing deeply, nervous)*  
> I don’t know how much longer I can stay here, man. He’s too close!

The guard passes again, but now **LEO**’s focus is on a window he notices in the back, right next to the alarm system.

> **LEO**  
> *(urgent, almost whispering)*  
> Hey, I’m going to try the window. If I run there, maybe I can disable the system in time.

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking quickly)*  
> Hold tight! Don’t do anything risky, just let me know when you’re there.

**LEO** starts moving slowly, with almost inaudible steps, until he reaches the window. He uses his stealth skills to not make a single sound. The guard is now on the opposite side of the store, checking the security cameras.  

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering into the headset)*  
> I’m getting to the window… just let me know if he’s close.

> **VINNY**  
> *(urgent)*  
> You’re almost there… just one more second… Now… ready! The system’s lost! He won’t have control over anything anymore!

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, relieved)*  
> Good! Now, let’s get out of here.

---

## Scene 4 - The Quick Exit

**LEO** runs silently toward the back door, his backpack now full of the NEXUS 9000. He glances over his shoulder, seeing the guard slowly walking away. The tension is at its peak, but he finally reaches the door, unlocks it, and steps out onto the street.

> **VINNY**  
> *(relaxed, but with a hint of relief)*  
> We did it, damn! I thought it was going to go wrong.

> **LEO**  
> *(laughing, taking a deep breath)*  
> It was close. But the console is ours! On to the next, my friend.

---

# Chapter 03

## Scene 1 - A New Plan

**Int. Living Room – Day**  
**LEO** and **VINNY** are on the couch, playing together on the *NEXUS 9000*, which now takes the prominent spot in the room. Their excitement is evident as they exchange laughs and teasing while playing.

> **LEO**  
> *(laughing while playing)*  
> Dude, check this out! This graph is insane. Totally worth every second of the scare from yesterday.

> **VINNY**  
> *(shrugging, with a satisfied smile)*  
> Yeah... I admit, it was risky, but now that it worked out, the adrenaline was worth it.

> **LEO**  
> *(thoughtfully, pausing the game)*  
> We made it, Vinny. And it was a store, you know? Even with the guard, we got out fine. Imagine what else we could do...

> **VINNY**  
> *(pretending indifference, but curious)*  
> Like what? You’re not telling me you’re already thinking of another “brilliant plan,” are you?

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, a glint in his eyes)*  
> I don’t know, what if it’s something a bit bigger? Something that would really pay off...

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at Leo with a mix of concern and excitement)*  
> Wait a minute... Are you serious? We’ve already got the console! Isn’t that enough?

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, excited)*  
> I know, but... after yesterday, it feels like we’ve got the hang of it. And if we do it right, there’s no reason to stop now, right?

---

## Scene 2 - The New Decision

**Int. Living Room – Day - A little later**  
**LEO** gets up from the couch, pacing back and forth, clearly excited about the idea. **VINNY** still hesitates but begins to see **LEO**'s growing enthusiasm, which starts to convince him.

> **LEO**  
> *(determined)*  
> Think about it... Next time, we pick a more strategic place, maybe somewhere where the security system isn’t so tough. We just need a target... somewhere the money or the items are worth the risk.

> **VINNY**  
> *(still cautious, but convinced)*  
> Alright, maybe. But no small stores. If we’re doing this, it’s going to be something bigger, with planning and no mistakes.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, satisfied)*  
> That’s the spirit! No amateur stuff. This time, we’ll do a real job.

---

## Scene 3 - Researching the Target

**Int. Vinny's Room - Night**  
**VINNY** is sitting at the computer, browsing websites and discreetly researching potential targets. He scrolls through event listings and local news, looking for something that catches his eye. **LEO** is next to him, watching closely.

> **LEO**  
> *(speaking quietly, thoughtful)*  
> It could be something with an easy security system to bypass... an electronics shop? Or somewhere we can get more than just a console...

> **VINNY**  
> *(staring at the screen)*  
> If we want something valuable, we need a place where the profit is high. Look at this... *(he points to the screen)* This warehouse from a tech store, it has stock of parts and new equipment.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, excited)*  
> Perfect! New equipment, advanced technology... and easy profit for those who know what to grab.

> **VINNY**  
> *(still unsure)*  
> But it’s a warehouse. The security is probably tougher than a regular store. What if the place has complex alarms?

> **LEO**  
> *(confident)*  
> That’s why you’re here, Vinny. You’ll be able to neutralize any system. We just need to study a bit more and... it’s done.

> **VINNY**  
> *(giving in, convinced)*  
> Alright, let’s go for it. But this time, no mistakes. I’ll start mapping out the security and see what I can do.

> **LEO**  
> *(patting Vinny’s shoulder, excited)*  
> That’s what I like to hear, partner! We’re going far.

---

## Scene 4 - Preparing the Plan

**Ext. Warehouse - Night**  
**LEO** and **VINNY** park the car on a deserted side street, with a good view of the warehouse. They watch the building from a distance, lit by some exterior lights and protected by an electronic gate.

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at the tablet, confident)*  
> Okay, first, let’s shut down the external camera system. Looks like they’re using an old system, shouldn’t be a problem.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, adjusting his mask)*  
> Easy, just let me know when I can go in.

> **VINNY**  
> *(typing quickly)*  
> Give me a minute... done, external cameras are off. No eyes on the gates. Go ahead.

> **LEO**  
> *(grabbing his backpack)*  
> Great. Keep me posted.

**VINNY** stays in the car, with the tablet on his lap and the laptop open beside him, while **LEO** approaches the warehouse, using the shadows to hide. **VINNY** starts accessing the internal camera system, typing commands quickly in the terminal.

---

## Scene 5 - An Unexpected Barrier

**Int. Warehouse - Entrance**  
**LEO** enters quietly through the blind spot identified by **VINNY**. He moves slowly through the poorly lit corridors, hearing only the distant sound of some equipment running.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering through the earpiece)*  
> I'm inside. How's it looking out there?

> **VINNY**  
> *(focused on the screens)*  
> All under control so far. The external cameras are down, but the internal surveillance is still active. Give me a minute...

While **VINNY** types quickly, the tablet suddenly shows an alert that appears as a pop-up window: "UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS DETECTED. LOCKDOWN IN PROGRESS."  

> **VINNY**  
> *(confused, typing frantically)*  
> Wait... What is this? No, this wasn’t in the system. They have something here that wasn’t in the plans...

A red light flashes on the screen, and the connection to the internal cameras is cut off, leaving **VINNY** in a panic.  

> **VINNY**  
> *(with a tense voice)*  
> Leo, something's wrong. I can't access the internal cameras. The security system detected a motion-triggered lockdown, and the firewall has been activated.

> **LEO**  
> *(stopping, looking around)*  
> Firewall? It was supposed to be an old system... Now I’m blind in here!

> **VINNY**  
> *(trying to stay calm, but already concerned)*  
> They must have a hidden backup system... Give me a second, I'll try to bypass this.

> **LEO**  
> *(crouching behind a shelf, impatient)*  
> I don't know how much time we have, Vinny. I can't see anything in here, and this place is a maze.

> **VINNY**  
> *(taking quick notes)*  
> Ok... main system, disabled. But there’s a subnet. I’ll try to hack that! The connection is limited, but not lost.

While **VINNY** works, **LEO** begins to realize that the alarm is closer than he thought. The light from a motion sensor in the back lights up. The countdown appears on **VINNY**'s tablet.  

> **VINNY**  
> *(focusing on the laptop screen)*  
> Just a few more seconds, Leo. I’ve breached the secondary network! I’ll try to disable the alarm manually. They won’t wait much longer, but... damn, we still have a shot.

The tension builds as **VINNY**'s tablet begins to show the countdown: "ALARM ACTIVATED. COUNTDOWN: 2 MINUTES."  

> **LEO**  
> *(urgently, in panic)*  
> Vinny, you have to hurry! I’m inside, but the police are coming, there’s no time left! Guards are walking around here!

> **VINNY**  
> *(desperately, typing quickly)*  
> I’m trying! I’m unlocking the system... almost there!

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering, moving to another section)*  
> I don’t have much time, the alarm’s sound will go off soon! Tell me you're close!

> **VINNY**  
> *(breathlessly, typing the commands)*  
> No time for mistakes, Leo... almost...!

On the laptop screen, **VINNY** types in a final command and presses "Enter." The tablet light flashes, and the connection to the security system is restored.  

> **VINNY**  
> *(relieved, but exhausted)*  
> I did it! The cameras are back online, and the alarm’s been deactivated. The police won’t be called... for now.

> **LEO**  
> *(relieved, laughing nervously)*  
> For now?! Are you crazy, Vinny?! You almost gave me a heart attack! And hey, I’m still in here!

> **VINNY**  
> *(calming down, but focused on the screens)*  
> I told you it would work, man. Now go! Grab what you need and get out, fast!

---

## Scene 6 - The Risky Choice

**Int. Warehouse - Technology Section**  
**LEO** runs to the technology section, dodging guards, finding boxes with various devices. He grabs some smaller items, putting them in the backpack quickly. Meanwhile, **VINNY** is in the car, trying to regain access to the system to ensure nothing else goes wrong.

> **LEO**  
> *(nervously smiling)*  
> Okay, okay, give me a second here, I’m grabbing some things... I’m already leaving.

> **VINNY**  
> *(scared)*  
> Get out of there now, Leo! The alarm was about to go off, and we still don’t know how many more guards are around here! Come on, hurry up!

> **LEO**  
> *(shouting through the earpiece)*  
> Calm down! Just a little longer! I’m not leaving empty-handed!

---

## Scene 7 - The Escape

**Ext. Warehouse - Street**  
**LEO** quickly escapes through the same entrance he came in, running to the car where **VINNY** has already started the engine. They speed off quickly, turning the corner to avoid the approaching patrols. Both are out of breath, but relieved to have escaped by a narrow margin.

> **LEO**  
> *(nervously smiling)*  
> Man, we almost screwed up back there, huh? That was close!

> **VINNY**  
> *(staring at Leo, irritated, but with a nervous smile)*  
> That was too much! But what matters is we made it. Just don’t do that again, okay?

> **LEO**  
> *(shrugging, with a confident smile)*  
> Oh, but look what we’ve got here... *(opens the backpack, showing the items)* ...worth it, right?

> **VINNY**  
> *(reluctantly, but smiling)*  
> You're an idiot, Leo. But in the end, you're an idiot who knows what he's doing.

Both laugh as the car disappears into the night, leaving the warehouse behind.

# Chapter 04

## Scene 1 - A Silent Morning

**Int. Leo's House - Kitchen - Morning**  
**LEO** is sitting at the kitchen table, wearing a wrinkled t-shirt. He drinks black coffee from a mug while slowly chewing a toast. The TV in the corner shows a news broadcast. He seems distracted until he hears the presenter mention something that makes him freeze. On the screen, images of the invaded warehouse appear, along with statements from the stolen company.

> **PRESENTER (on TV)**  
> *"Authorities confirmed that the TechSecure warehouse was attacked last night. Initial reports suggest that hackers breached the system, allowing access to the location. The company is investigating whether anything was stolen."*

> **LEO**  
> *(stopping mid-bite, eyes wide open)*  
> Oh, no… No, no, no, no…

He grabs his phone and quickly dials **VINNY**.

---

## Scene 2 - Tense Reunion

**Int. Vinny's House - Bedroom - Morning**  
**VINNY** is sitting in front of several computer screens, typing quickly while speaking on speakerphone with **LEO**.

> **LEO**  
> *(getting straight to the point, desperate)*  
> Did you see the news? We're on the news, Vinny! They're saying they hacked TechSecure's system!

> **VINNY**  
> *(calmly, still typing)*  
> I saw. It's all under control, Leo.

> **LEO**  
> *(speaking loudly, pacing back and forth)*  
> Under control?! What do you mean under control? The police are going to knock on our door any minute!

> **VINNY**  
> *(stopping what he's doing and turning to look at the phone on the table)*  
> Leo, listen. I erased everything. Logs, access records, external cameras. There's nothing that links us.

> **LEO**  
> *(more annoyed)*  
> And if they recover it? These guys have experts, Vinny!

> **VINNY**  
> *(sighs)*  
> If they recover it, they'll only find a trail of fake data I planted. Trust me, man.

> **LEO**  
> *(pausing, taking a deep breath, still nervous)*  
> I… I don't know. This feels so big.

> **VINNY**  
> *(seriously)*  
> Leo, look at me. I know what I'm doing. Do you trust me or not?

> **LEO**  
> *(still uneasy, but shaking his head)*  
> I trust you… But this still gives me chills.

---

## Scene 3 - Growing Ambition

**Int. Vinny's House - Bedroom - Night**  
**VINNY** is sitting in front of a virtual map on the main monitor, while other screens show schematics and possible targets. **LEO** is on the floor, lying with a scribbled notebook beside him.

> **LEO**  
> *(looking at the ceiling)*  
> If we did this, what else can we do?

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at the monitors, distracted)*  
> Something bigger. Much bigger.

> **LEO**  
> *(raising his head, interested)*  
> Bigger how?

> **VINNY**  
> *(turning to him, with a slight smile)*  
> Let's start with a bank.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling slowly)*  
> You're crazy.

> **VINNY**  
> *(seriously, but with shining eyes)*  
> Maybe. But you know we can do it.

---

## Scene 4 - Ambitious Planning

**Int. Vinny's House - Bedroom - Night**  
The room is messy, with food leftovers on the table and cables scattered across the floor. **VINNY**'s screens are filled with schematics, blueprints, and equipment lists. **LEO** is sitting on the bed, fidgeting with a pen, while **VINNY** is in his swivel chair, explaining the plan.

> **VINNY**  
> *(gesturing to the main screen)*  
> Okay, so here's what we need: an electronics store downtown. It's not huge, but it has enough equipment for us to level up.

> **LEO**  
> *(looking at the store's blueprint)*  
> And what exactly are we taking from there?

> **VINNY**  
> *(turning to him)*  
> High-resolution cameras, motion sensors... Maybe a more robust router so I can set up our network better.

> **LEO**  
> *(frowning)*  
> And how are we getting in? We can't just repeat the warehouse scheme.

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling)*  
> I've already thought of that. They have a back door with an electronic lock. With the right equipment, we can open it without triggering the alarm.

> **LEO**  
> *(sighing)*  
> And where do we get the "right equipment"?

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking slowly, as if revealing something genius)*  
> We get it... from the store itself.

> **LEO**  
> *(raising his head, surprised)*  
> Steal from the store to steal more from it later?

> **VINNY**  
> *(laughing)*  
> Exactly. First, a quick hit to grab some basic tools. Then, we come back for everything.

> **LEO**  
> *(shaking his head, thoughtful)*  
> You're insane.

> **VINNY**  
> *(shrugging)*  
> Maybe. But I'm an efficient insane.

## Scene 5 - The First Store Heist

**Ext. Electronics Store - Day**  
The electronics store is modern and vibrant, with a minimalist design and windows full of futuristic gadgets. **LEO** and **VINNY** are standing outside, blending in with the pedestrians. The street is busy, and the store is filled with customers exploring the latest technological innovations. **LEO** is wearing sunglasses and is disguised with a cap. He carries a small backpack. **VINNY**, standing at a café nearby, has a laptop on the table, watching the movement through the window.

> **VINNY**  
> *(via hidden radio in his earpiece)*  
> Okay, Leo. The device is in the advanced gadgets section, middle shelf. Remember, the name is SignalPro-X. It's small, looks like a power bank.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering as he enters the store)*  
> Got it. Are you sure you disabled the cameras?

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling, confident)*  
> Absolutely sure. For now, you just need to look like any regular customer.

**Int. Electronics Store - Day**  
**LEO** enters the store, pretending to be interested in some products. He stops at a gadget shelf, grabs some random devices, and pretends to read them while locating the SignalPro-X.

> **VINNY**  
> *(via radio)*  
> See it? It's on the middle shelf, next to the holographic display.

> **LEO**  
> *(quietly)*  
> Yes, I found it. But there are too many people around.

Meanwhile, **VINNY** is monitoring the store's security system. He notices something on the laptop and types frantically.

> **VINNY**  
> *(urgently)*  
> Leo, the anti-theft sensors are active. I can't disable them remotely for much longer. If you leave with this without paying, they'll notice.

> **LEO**  
> *(irritated)*  
> Great, what do I do now?

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking around the café, thinking quickly)*  
> Go to the cashier, buy something cheap, and use it as a distraction. When you pass the item through the sensor, I'll overload the system. That should confuse the alarms for a few seconds.

> **LEO**  
> *(sighing)*  
> Are you sure about this?

> **VINNY**  
> *(confident)*  
> Trust me.

**LEO** grabs a cheap phone case and heads to the cashier. He stands in line, staying calm as the people in front of him are attended to.

> **VINNY**  
> *(via radio, while typing)*  
> As soon as you scan the item, I'll trigger the loop. But you need to leave quickly.

**LEO** finally reaches the cashier. He hands over the phone case, trying to look casual.

> **CASHIER**  
> *(smiling)*  
> Is that all for today?

> **LEO**  
> *(without hesitation)*  
> That's all.

While the **CASHIER** registers the item, **VINNY** activates his interference. The store's security system flickers briefly, as if it had a short circuit. **LEO**, without wasting time, places the SignalPro-X in his backpack while grabbing the change.

> **VINNY**  
> *(via radio, hurried)*  
> Now, get out of there!

**LEO** thanks the **CASHIER** and walks calmly out the door, maintaining a neutral expression until he turns the corner. As soon as he's out of sight, he runs to the café where **VINNY** is waiting.

> **LEO**  
> *(throwing the backpack on the table)*  
> That was way too risky.

> **VINNY**  
> *(giving a slight smile as he closes the laptop)*  
> But it worked, didn’t it?

> **LEO**  
> *(rolling his eyes, but smiling)*  
> This time.

They both look at the backpack with the SignalPro-X, knowing that they now have the necessary tool for the next step.

## Scene 6 - Game Changer

**Int. Leo's House - Living Room - Night**  
**LEO** is sitting on the couch, watching the news with a tense expression. On the screen, the presenter appears again, this time with a calmer tone.

> **PRESENTER (on TV)**  
> *"After internal analysis, TechSecure confirmed that the incident was the result of a security system failure. No items were stolen, and the company assures that all protocols have been reviewed."*

> **LEO**  
> *(standing up, incredulous)*  
> What do you mean "no items were stolen"? They don't know anything?

**LEO**'s phone rings. He picks up, it's **VINNY**.

> **LEO**  
> *(still nervous)*  
> Did you see that? Do they really think it was a mistake?

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling, calm)*  
> I told you everything was under control. They covered it up. They must be trying to save face.

> **LEO**  
> *(still agitated)*  
> But what if they find out later? What if this comes back to us?

> **VINNY**  
> *(more serious, but confident)*  
> It won't. I’ve closed all the loose ends. Now relax.

> **LEO**  
> *(sitting down on the couch, sighing)*  
> Okay… Okay, but I still think that was too close.

> **VINNY**  
> *(laughs on the other end of the line)*  
> If it was close, it was a close call I was handling.

> **LEO**  
> *(laughs a little nervously, but relieved)*  
> You're a bastard, you know that?

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling)*  
> That's why you need me. Now, about the next step…

# Chapter 04

## Scene 1 - Strategy and Entry

**Int. Vinny's Apartment - Night**  
**VINNY**'s living room is transformed into a small operations center, with multiple screens displaying the store's diagrams and the functioning of the SignalPro-X. He is seated at the computer while **LEO** leans over the table, focused on the plan.

> **VINNY**  
> *(pointing at the screens)*  
> Here's the store. The main hallway leads to the storage room, but the entrance is secured by sensors and a keypad door.

> **LEO**  
> *(raising an eyebrow)*  
> And what are you going to do with that?

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling)*  
> The SignalPro-X can intercept the code generated by the door as soon as the sensor is triggered. It sends me the code, I pass it to you, and boom, the door opens.

> **LEO**  
> *(scratching his chin)*  
> And the security guard?

> **VINNY**  
> *(gesturing at another screen)*  
> That's where my camera access comes in. I'll monitor everything inside and guide you to the blind spot. He makes his rounds every 15 minutes, so we'll have a short window.

> **LEO**  
> *(lightly tapping the table, confident)*  
> Sounds easy.

> **VINNY**  
> *(seriously)*  
> Don't underestimate this, Leo. If he catches us, it's over. And remember: no drawing attention.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling)*  
> Got it, Mr. Nerd.

**Ext. Store - Night**  
The store, illuminated only by streetlights and a few spotlights in the alley, appears peaceful. **LEO** is crouched near the loading entrance while **VINNY** monitors the cameras remotely.

> **VINNY**  
> *(quietly, over the radio)*  
> The dock camera is pointing the other way. You have five seconds to cross. Go now.

**LEO** quickly runs, positioning himself by the loading door. He looks at the camera lens, which blinks faintly.

> **LEO**  
> *(quietly, on the radio)*  
> I'm at the door. Activate SignalPro.

**VINNY** types frantically, activating the SignalPro-X. One of his screens shows the sensor panel connected to the door.

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at the screen)*  
> Sensor triggered. Hold on... Done, the code is 7942.

**LEO** quickly enters the code, and the door clicks softly before opening.

> **LEO**  
> *(lowering his voice)*  
> Door's open. I'm going in.

**Int. Store Loading Area - Night**  
The space is tight, with stacked boxes and dim lighting. **LEO** moves cautiously as **VINNY** continues guiding him.

> **VINNY**  
> *(watching the screen)*  
> The guard is at the front section. You're clear, but there's another camera to your left. I'll create a blind spot... hold on... now, go!

**LEO** moves quickly, avoiding the camera. He reaches the main hallway but stops upon hearing footsteps.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering)*  
> He's close.

> **VINNY**  
> *(watching through the cameras)*  
> Relax, he's heading to the showcase area. Stay low and wait for him to leave.

**LEO** complies, hiding behind some boxes. The **GUARD** walks by slowly, inspecting the hallway before turning the corner.

> **VINNY**  
> *(relieved)*  
> All clear. Move forward, but be careful; the next sensor is active. I'll need another minute.

> **LEO**  
> *(impatiently)*  
> Make it quick, Vinny.

**VINNY** works quickly at the computer while **LEO** waits, his eyes fixed on the hallway.

---

## Scene 2 - The First Obstacle

**Int. Main Hallway of the Store - Night**  
**LEO** walks silently to a metal door with an electronic panel beside it. He observes the surroundings. A camera is strategically positioned above the door, its lens focused directly on the entrance.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering over the radio)*  
> Vinny, the door is here, but there's a camera staring right at me.

> **VINNY**  
> *(watching the screens)*  
> I see it. The guard is also patrolling near you. Wait, I'll try to divert the camera.

**VINNY** types quickly on the keyboard but frowns at the system's response.

> **VINNY**  
> *(frustrated)*  
> No way. This model has redundant locking. I can only disable it for a few seconds.

> **LEO**  
> *(impatient)*  
> That's enough. Just tell me when.

> **VINNY**  
> *(stressed)*  
> When I disable it, you need to run. Go straight to the door, use the SignalPro-X, and get in. I'll handle the rest.

> **LEO**  
> *(confident)*  
> Leave it to me.

**VINNY** presses a sequence of commands, and the camera's light temporarily goes out.

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking quickly)*  
> Go! You have ten seconds before it resets.

**LEO** rushes to the door. He grabs the SignalPro-X, connects it to the panel, and waits for the code to be generated in **VINNY**'s system.

> **VINNY**  
> *(focused)*  
> Four... two... done! Code is 7824.

**LEO** types the code, and the door unlocks. He quickly enters, closing it behind him as the camera comes back online.

---

## Scene 3 - Special Equipment

**Int. Equipment Storage - Night**  
The room is modest, with shelves full of devices. They're not high-tech items, but far beyond what you'd find in a regular store.

**LEO** scans the environment while **VINNY** gives instructions over the radio.

> **VINNY**  
> *(instructing)*  
> You're looking for five specific items. First, a CamBlocker – it disables nearby cameras for a few seconds. That’ll come in handy now.

**LEO** finds a box labeled CamBlocker. He opens it and pulls out a small black device with quick activation buttons.

> **LEO**  
> *(satisfied)*  
> One down. What's next?

> **VINNY**  
> *(checking his list)*  
> Look for a KeyScan, the universal reader for basic password panels. It should be on a nearby shelf.

**LEO** moves quickly, grabbing the KeyScan. He continues filling his bag with a Reflector (capable of redirecting security signals), a Disruptor (creates noise to distract nearby guards), and a LatchFreeze (freezes mechanical locks for a few seconds).

> **LEO**  
> *(checking the items)*  
> All here. How do I get out?

> **VINNY**  
> *(concerned)*  
> The guard is closer to your exit now, and you won't go unnoticed by the camera. Use the CamBlocker to kill the camera when you leave.

> **LEO**  
> *(smirking)*  
> I knew this toy would be worth it.

---

## Scene 4 - The Tight Escape

**Int. Main Hallway of the Store - Night**  
**LEO** approaches the door he entered through, hidden in the shadows. The guard is patrolling the main hallway, his flashlight illuminating the path.

> **VINNY**  
> *(alerting)*  
> The guard will turn the corner in thirty seconds. You need to act now.

**LEO** activates the CamBlocker, which emits a faint BEEP. The camera's light goes out again, and he runs to the door.

> **LEO**  
> *(working quickly)*  
> Unlocking...

He uses the SignalPro-X to unlock the door, and in less than ten seconds, he's out, returning to the blind spot in the loading dock.

> **VINNY**  
> *(relieved)*  
> You out?

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling)*  
> Easier than it looks.

> **VINNY**  
> *(sarcastic)*  
> Say that now, but I was the one running after the code.

> **LEO**  
> *(shrugging)*  
> Teamwork at its finest. Time to head home.

---

## Scene 5 - The Final Challenge

**Int. Main Corridor of the Store - Night**  
**LEO**, carrying the backpack with the equipment, moves carefully after leaving the equipment room. He turns off the CamBlocker, and the camera starts working again. The environment is silent, but he knows he cannot let his guard down.

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking over the radio)*  
> Leo, good news: the camera is back to normal and the guard is still in the main corridor.

> **LEO**  
> *(sighing with relief)*  
> Great, so the path is clear?

> **VINNY**  
> *(pausing, looking at another screen)*  
> Wait... damn. There's another guard in the loading dock. He's near the exit, standing still.

> **LEO**  
> *(irritated)*  
> Two guards? This wasn’t part of the plan, Vinny!

> **VINNY**  
> *(calmly)*  
> Relax, we’ll improvise. I’ll guide you to a spot where you can create a distraction. Stay with me.

**LEO** follows **VINNY**'s instructions, avoiding cameras and dodging the first guard, who passes just a few feet away. He hides behind stacked boxes and watches the second guard, who is in front of the exit door, seemingly distracted but with a vigilant posture.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering)*  
> Vinny, he’s not leaving anytime soon. Any bright ideas?

> **VINNY**  
> *(thinking)*  
> Okay, to your left there’s a fire alarm panel. I can trigger it remotely, but it will attract the attention of all the guards. You’ll need to run to get out.

> **LEO**  
> *(firmly)*  
> Do it. I’m ready.

**VINNY** types quickly on his computer, and a loud alarm sound echoes through the store.

> **ALARM**  
> *(loud)*  
> BEEP! BEEP! BEEP! Attention! Fire detected! Immediate evacuation!

The guard near the exit grabs his radio, confused, and runs to check the alarm, clearing the way.

> **VINNY**  
> *(shouting over the radio)*  
> Now, Leo! Go!

**LEO** runs silently to the exit, staying in the shadows. He carefully pushes the door to avoid making noise and steps out into the blind spot of the loading dock.

**Ext. Rear Parking Lot - Night**  
**LEO** escapes into the parking lot and takes a deep breath, trying to calm his adrenaline. He whispers into the radio.

> **LEO**  
> *(relieved)*  
> I’m out. That was tight.

> **VINNY**  
> *(also relieved)*  
> I told you we’d improvise. Now get out of here before anyone sees you.

**LEO** disappears into the darkness, carrying the backpack with the stolen equipment.

---

## Scene 6 – Inventory and Ambition

**Int. Vinny’s House – Night**  
**LEO** and **VINNY** are sitting at the kitchen table, with the backpack open on the surface. The stolen equipment is spread out, and both are carefully examining each item, excitement and relief written on their faces.

> **LEO**  
> *(picking up the KeyScan)*  
> This one’s the star of the night. Just plug it in and it captures any access code in seconds.

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling, satisfied)*  
> This will save a lot of work. No more guessing security codes or breaking down doors like amateurs.

> **LEO**  
> *(raising the Reflector)*  
> And this one? Redirect signals? We can even fool motion sensors if we know how to use this right.

> **VINNY**  
> *(thoughtful)*  
> Perfect for creating confusion. Combined with the Disruptor, the guards will be completely lost.

> **LEO**  
> *(picking up the Disruptor)*  
> Noise to distract nearby security... I won’t lie, I’m already imagining using this to send a guard away while you disable the cameras.

> **VINNY**  
> *(pointing at the LatchFreeze)*  
> And this one is simple but genius. Freezes mechanical locks for a few seconds. Enough to get in and out without even touching them.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling with satisfaction)*  
> That was one hell of an upgrade. Now we have tools for bigger games.

> **VINNY**  
> *(more seriously, looking at Leo)*  
> Yeah, but you saw how close it was today. It was by a hair. One wrong move and we’d be behind bars.

> **LEO**  
> *(shrugging, with a sparkle in his eyes)*  
> That just makes things more exciting. And, between us, this is just the beginning. These toys are good, but we’re still far from stealing something truly big.

> **VINNY**  
> *(worried, but also excited)*  
> We need to plan carefully. This gives us more options, but it doesn’t make us invisible.

> **LEO**  
> *(getting up and grabbing the Reflector)*  
> Invisible, no. But smart, yes. And the next target is going to be bigger, Vinny. Much bigger.

**VINNY** hesitates for a moment, but **LEO**'s enthusiasm is contagious. He shrugs, knowing they are stepping into something even more dangerous.

---

# Chapter 06

## Scene 1 – The Foreseen Crisis

**Int. Leo's Apartment – Day**  
**LEO** is sitting on the couch in a small, dimly lit apartment. The TV is on, tuned to a news channel, while he absentmindedly flips through an old magazine. There’s an empty plate on the coffee table and an open beer bottle. His expression is a mix of weariness and restlessness.

> **NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)**  
> *"... and in other news, the economic impact caused by the financial scandal at NeoTech Industries continues to be felt on a global scale."*

**LEO** looks up at the TV, frowning. He turns up the volume with the remote control.

> **NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)**  
> *"The corporation, which controls sectors in technology, healthcare, and infrastructure, faces accusations of market manipulation and public fund mismanagement. Experts say the consequences could be irreversible for many families."*

Footage shows people protesting in the streets, holding signs against NeoTech. Some display despair on their faces, while others shout slogans of outrage.

> **NEWS ANCHOR (V.O.)**  
> *"The company’s CEO, Elliot Crane, has yet to make an official statement. Authorities are investigating allegations that part of Crane’s fortune is hidden in cryptocurrencies, secured by advanced systems."*

**LEO** scoffs, annoyed, and turns off the TV.

> **LEO**  
> *(crossing his arms)*  
> The world’s falling apart, and that guy still sleeps on a bed made of money.

**LEO** grabs his phone and dials Vinny.

---

## Scene 2 – Vinny’s Morning Routine

**Int. Vinny's Apartment – Day**  
**VINNY** is in the kitchen of his small apartment. He’s wearing an old t-shirt and sweatpants, his hair messy. A toaster pops, releasing two slices of toast. The TV plays the same news broadcast.

> **TV ANCHOR (V.O.)**  
> *"... analysts say NeoTech Industries might face severe sanctions, but critics argue the legal system sides with billionaires."*

**VINNY** mutters something inaudible, grabs the toast, and starts spreading butter on it. He glances at the open laptop on the counter, displaying various graphs and codes. His phone buzzes on the table. He answers without looking at the screen.

> **VINNY**  
> *(chewing)*  
> Hey, Leo.

> **LEO (V.O.)**  
> *Are you watching this? This NeoTech thing?*

> **VINNY**  
> *(taking a sip of coffee)*  
> It’s been in the news for weeks. So what?

> **LEO (V.O.)**  
> *“So what?”! They’ve destroyed everything! My uncles lost their jobs, and half the families I know are on the streets. We can’t just sit and watch.*

> **VINNY**  
> *(sighing, serious)*  
> I know. My sister’s in the same boat. They cut her scholarship program due to lack of funds.

> **LEO (V.O.)**  
> *This can’t go on. We’ve pulled off big stuff before, but this…*

> **VINNY**  
> *(interrupting)*  
> This is different, Leo. NeoTech isn’t some empty warehouse with two guards. This is another level.

**VINNY** stares at his laptop, his eyes fixed on a line of code paused mid-edit.

> **LEO (V.O.)**  
> *You always say that, but in the end, we make it work.*

> **VINNY**  
> *(quietly, to himself)*  
> But at what cost?

---

## Scene 3 – Personal Repercussions

**Ext. City Streets – Afternoon**  
**LEO** and **VINNY** walk together down a busy street. On the opposite sidewalk, a small protest is underway. People hold banners that read “Justice for Families!” and “Take Down NeoTech!”.

> **LEO**  
> *(pointing at the protesters)*  
> See that? This is just the beginning. People won’t take this for much longer.

> **VINNY**  
> *(adjusting his glasses)*  
> And what’s your plan? Break into NeoTech and steal Crane’s crypto?

> **LEO**  
> *(stopping)*  
> Why not? Didn’t you want something big?

**VINNY** looks at him, incredulous.

> **VINNY**  
> You’re crazy. They have digital and physical security that makes other places look like child’s play.

> **LEO**  
> *(seriously)*  
> You said the same about TechSecure’s warehouse. And look at that.

> **VINNY**  
> *(lowering his voice, glancing around)*  
> This is different. It’s not a warehouse. It’s a corporate fortress with eyes everywhere.

> **LEO**  
> And you don’t think it’s worth trying? For what they did to your sister? To my family?

**VINNY** hesitates, clearly torn between logic and anger. He lowers his eyes to the ground, thoughtful.

---

## Scene 4 – The Target

**Int. Vinny's Apartment – Night**  
**VINNY** is seated in front of his screen, filled with graphs and digital maps. He’s researching NeoTech while **LEO** stands behind him with his arms crossed.

> **VINNY**  
> *(reluctantly)*  
> If we’re going to do this, we need a plan. And we’ll need more than what we have now.

> **LEO**  
> *(patting VINNY on the shoulder)*  
> I knew you’d be on board.

**VINNY** rolls his eyes but begins drafting a schematic on the monitor.

> **VINNY**  
> They have autonomous surveillance systems, human patrols, and drones. But the heart of their operation is the DataCore, where they keep digital records and… probably Crane’s crypto.

> **LEO**  
> *(gravely)*  
> And what do we need to get in?

> **VINNY**  
> *(thoughtfully)*  
> Tools. More sophisticated than what we’ve used before. And maybe… outside help.

> **LEO**  
> *(suspiciously)*  
> Help from who?

**VINNY** hesitates, looking away, but doesn’t answer.

---

## Scene 5 – The Family Context

**Int. Vinny's House - Night**  
**VINNY**'s house is modest, with old but well-maintained furniture. The living room is dimly lit by the TV, playing a random program that no one is paying attention to. His mother is folding clothes in an armchair while his father reads a newspaper in another. His younger sister, **CLARA**, is in the corner of the room, scribbling in a school notebook. **VINNY** enters through the front door, carrying his backpack and looking exhausted.

> **MOTHER**  
> *(calmly)*  
> You’re late today, Vinny.

> **VINNY**  
> *(relaxed, forcing a smile)*  
> Had to take care of a few things, Mom.

> **FATHER**  
> *(without looking up from the newspaper)*  
> If you’re studying this much, I hope it’s worth it.

> **CLARA**  
> *(sarcastic, without lifting her head from the notebook)*  
> He’s studying how to become a computer genius.

> **VINNY**  
> *(playfully, dropping his backpack in a corner)*  
> I already am, you just don’t know it yet.

Everyone chuckles softly, but the mood grows serious when **CLARA** sets down her pencil and looks at **VINNY**.

> **CLARA**  
> Vinny... do you think we’re going to be okay?

> **VINNY**  
> *(stopping, surprised by the question)*  
> Why are you asking that?

> **CLARA**  
> *(quietly)*  
> What’s going to happen to us if Dad loses his job too?

**VINNY** glances at his parents, who avoid his gaze. He kneels beside **CLARA**, trying to sound confident.

> **VINNY**  
> It’s going to be okay. We always find a way, don’t we?

> **CLARA**  
> *(looking at him)*  
> Promise?

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling despite the tension)*  
> I promise.

His sister smiles faintly and goes back to her notebook. **VINNY** stands up and looks at his parents, who exchange silent glances. He heads upstairs to his room, clearly burdened by **CLARA**’s words.

---

## Scene 6 – A Decision in the Dark

**Int. Vinny's Room - Night**  
**VINNY**’s room is small and messy, with computer parts scattered across the desk and a swivel chair with worn upholstery. He sits in front of his laptop, turning it on as he reflects on his conversation with **CLARA**. **LEO** appears in a video call.

> **LEO (on screen)**  
> So? Did you think about what I said?

> **VINNY**  
> *(sighing)*  
> I did. But, Leo, this won’t be easy. We’re talking about a level of security we’ve never faced before.

> **LEO**  
> *(determined)*  
> We don’t have a choice. **VINNY**, look around you. This is affecting everyone.

**VINNY** looks at the screen, but he seems lost in thought.

> **VINNY**  
> *(quietly)*  
> I know.

He types something on the keyboard, opening a digital map showing the locations of NeoTech’s main buildings. He zooms in on an area marked “DataCore.”

> **VINNY**  
> If we’re going to do this, we’ll need internal information. Building plans, security routes, and most importantly, how to access the DataCore without setting off alarms.

> **LEO (on screen)**  
> And you can get that, right?

> **VINNY**  
> *(without looking away)*  
> I can, but it’ll take time. And more resources than we have right now.

> **LEO (on screen)**  
> Then we’ll do whatever it takes. Anything.

**VINNY** hesitates again, staring at a folder on his desktop. He doesn’t open it but hovers the cursor over it.

> **VINNY**  
> *(whispering to himself)*  
> “Anything,” huh?

---

## Scene 7 – The Next Step

**Int. Vinny's Room - Early Morning**  
**VINNY** is still awake, surrounded by screens and notes. Light footsteps echo in the hallway. The bedroom door slowly opens, revealing **CLARA** holding her notebook.

> **CLARA**  
> *(sleepily)*  
> You’re still up?

> **VINNY**  
> *(smiling, tired)*  
> Just working on a few things.

**CLARA** steps into the room and observes the screens flashing with codes and graphs.

> **CLARA**  
> You’re going to help us, aren’t you?

**VINNY** stops what he’s doing and looks at her. He smiles and ruffles her hair.

> **VINNY**  
> Always.

**CLARA** leaves the room, and **VINNY** turns back to his main screen. He opens the folder, revealing a message from ShadeNet: “We await your decision. We are ready.” He stares at the message for a long moment before closing the laptop.

> **VINNY**  
> *(quietly, to himself)*  
> Let’s see where this leads.

---

# Chapter 07

## Scene 1 – In the Middle of the Crowd

**Ext. Main entrance of the NeoTech administrative building – Afternoon**

**LEO** walks along the sidewalk, backpack slung over one shoulder and a casual demeanor, while **VINNY** sits at a café across the street, laptop open and headphones on. The building’s main entrance is bustling with employees and visitors coming and going.

> **VINNY**  
> *(voice over communicator)*  
> Can you hear me?

> **LEO**  
> *(adjusting the small earpiece)*  
> Loud and clear. What’s the final plan again?

> **VINNY**  
> *(checking the laptop screen)*  
> The main server access room. That’s where they keep the security system data for NeoTech. If we can clone the biometric access, we’ll have a chance to get into any building they control.

> **LEO**  
> *(sarcastically)*  
> Oh, that’s all? No pressure at all.

> **VINNY**  
> *(ironically)*  
> Relax. Just get past the entrance full of cameras, deal with the biometric scanner, and leave without raising any suspicion. Simple.

---

## Scene 2 – Blending In

**Int. Reception of the NeoTech administrative building – Afternoon**

**LEO** enters through the main door, blending into the crowd. He discreetly observes the guards near the metal detector and the ceiling-mounted camera sweeping the area like a spotlight.

> **LEO**  
> *(low, into the communicator)*  
> It’s packed here. Got any brilliant plans?

> **VINNY**  
> *(calmly)*  
> Pretend you work there. The detector only stops people without badges.

> **LEO**  
> *(looking around)*  
> And where do I get a badge?

> **VINNY**  
> *(checking the laptop)*  
> There’s an employee heading out the side door. Take theirs.

## Scene 3 – The First Hurdle

**Ext. Side of the NeoTech administrative building – Afternoon**

**LEO** follows a distracted man walking toward a trash can with a badge clipped to his waist. He waits for the right moment, bumps into him intentionally, and swipes the badge unnoticed.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling)*  
> Got it.

> **VINNY**  
> Good. Now head back to the main entrance and go straight to the elevators.

**Int. Elevators of the administrative building – Afternoon**

**LEO** passes through the detector without issue, pretending to look at his phone. He enters a crowded elevator, pressing the button for the third floor.

## Scene 4 – Heading to the Server Room

**Int. Third-floor hallway – Afternoon**

**LEO** exits the elevator and finds the hallway surprisingly empty. Following **VINNY**’s instructions, he reaches a door with a biometric scanner.

> **LEO**  
> *(looking at the door)*  
> Biometric scanner. That’s your area.

> **VINNY**  
> *(calmly)*  
> Connect the KeyScan to the side panel. It’ll capture the last used data and replicate it.

**LEO** pulls the KeyScan from his backpack and connects it to the panel. The device emits a faint hum as it works.

> **LEO**  
> *(impatiently)*  
> How long is this gonna take?

> **VINNY**  
> *(calculating)*  
> About twenty seconds. Just don’t move.

Suddenly, a guard appears in the hallway, walking toward **LEO**.

## Scene 5 – Avoiding Trouble

**LEO** quickly turns his back to the guard, pretending to fiddle with his phone while the KeyScan continues working. The guard stops near him.

> **GUARD**  
> *(suspiciously)*  
> Do you work here?

> **LEO**  
> *(nervous smile)*  
> Of course. I forgot my badge at reception but needed to grab some data here.

> **GUARD**  
> *(narrowing his eyes)*  
> Right, but...

Before the guard can finish, the KeyScan beeps, indicating it’s done. **LEO** disconnects the device and steps away from the door.

> **LEO**  
> *(interrupting the guard)*  
> I’m heading back down now. Thanks for your concern!

He hurries down the hallway before the guard can react.

## Scene 6 – The Second Problem

**Int. Staircase – Afternoon**

**LEO** rushes down the stairs but hears footsteps and voices coming from below. He enters a mid-level floor, trying to avoid another encounter.

> **VINNY**  
> *(urgent, over the comms)*  
> There’s a service elevator at the end of this floor. Use it to get out.

> **LEO**  
> *(grumbling)*  
> This building’s a maze...

He heads towards the elevator but finds a locked door. Without hesitation, he uses the LatchFreeze to unlock it and steps into the elevator.

## Scene 7 – Timely Discovery

**Int. NeoTech Document Room – Afternoon**

**LEO** moves down the corridor as **VINNY** monitors from a café, typing frantically on his laptop. **LEO** passes by an open room and stops when he sees something unusual: an employee left in a hurry, leaving the door ajar, several boxes of files, and an active terminal inside.

> **LEO**  
> *(looking into the room)*  
> Vinny, there’s a room here full of documents. Looks like they left the door open.

> **VINNY**  
> *(a bit skeptical)*  
> This wasn’t in the plan. But if there’s anything useful, grab it. Just don’t take too long.

**LEO** enters quietly, closing the door behind him.

**Int. Document Room – Afternoon**

**LEO** walks to the terminal and quickly examines the files in the boxes. He finds a folder labeled “Sensitive Projects” and opens it, revealing detailed blueprints of another NeoTech building with security system markings.

> **LEO**  
> *(holding up a blueprint to the communicator’s camera)*  
> Check this out. They’ve got security layouts for other buildings. This will make things much easier in the future.

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking through the camera feed)*  
> This is pure gold. Grab whatever you can and get out of there.

**LEO** packs the documents into his backpack, but before leaving, he glances at the active terminal.

> **LEO**  
> There’s a computer here. Is it worth checking out?

> **VINNY**  
> *(quickly)*  
> Plug in the KeyScan. It’ll clone access and save anything relevant. Just be mindful of the time.

**LEO** plugs the KeyScan into the terminal’s USB port. The screen flickers, indicating data transfer. However, a silent alarm begins to sound on the floor.

## Scene 8 – Racing Against the Clock

**Int. Document Room – Afternoon**

**LEO** notices a red light blinking in the corner of the room.

> **LEO**  
> *(urgent)*  
> Vinny, I think an alarm just went off.

> **VINNY**  
> *(calmer than he should be)*  
> It’s probably the system detecting the transfer. The KeyScan’s almost done. Hang tight.

Outside, voices and hurried footsteps echo in the hallway. **LEO** glances nervously at the door as the device completes the download.

> **KEYSCAN**  
> *(digital voice)*  
> Transfer complete.

> **LEO**  
> *(relieved)*  
> Got it. Now how do I get out of here?

---

## Scene 9 – An Improvised Exit

**Int. Third-Floor Hallway – Afternoon**

**LEO** steps out of the room and looks both ways down the hallway. Two guards approach from one direction, while the other is blocked by an employee using a vending machine.

> **VINNY**  
> *(watching through the feed)*  
> Left’s bad. Right’s worse. Hang on...

At the café, **VINNY** types rapidly, accessing the building’s control system. He triggers a fire alarm at the end of the hallway.

> **BUILDING ALARM**  
> *(over speakers)*  
> Attention: immediate evacuation required.

Employees start exiting their offices, confused. The guards hesitate briefly but soon move to guide people out.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling)*  
> Nice move.

> **VINNY**  
> *(satisfied)*  
> Don’t thank me yet. Just get out of there.

**LEO** blends into the crowd and enters the emergency staircase.

## Scene 10 – The Exit

**Ext. Side Entrance of the Building – Afternoon**

**LEO** exits through the side, blending in with the evacuees. He walks quickly towards the café where **VINNY** is waiting.

**Int. Café – Afternoon**

**LEO** sits at the table, still catching his breath. He opens his backpack, pulling out the documents and the KeyScan.

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at the documents)*  
> These blueprints are amazing. What did the KeyScan pick up?

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling)*  
> Everything that was on that terminal. Hope it’s useful.

> **VINNY**  
> *(confident)*  
> It will be. This gives us an edge for something bigger.

> **LEO**  
> *(raising an eyebrow)*  
> You’re already planning the next hit?

> **VINNY**  
> *(grinning)*  
> It is already done.

They exchange knowing glances as the café around them continues its routine, unaware of what just transpired.
