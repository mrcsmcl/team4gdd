# Main Menu

The Main Menu will be the player's first interaction with the game. It will feature a sleek, minimalistic design, with a cyberpunk aesthetic to match the game’s setting. Neon accents and a clean, futuristic font style will dominate the layout, keeping the focus on ease of use and clarity.

## Menu Options:
- Start Game (Co-op or Single-player mode)
- Continue Game (Resume saved progress)
- Speedrun Mode (For competitive time trials)
- Settings (Audio, video, and control adjustments)
- Credits
- Quit

## Settings Menu:
- Audio: Master volume, music, sound effects, and voice levels.
- Graphics: Quality settings, resolution, V-Sync, and performance mode.
- Controls: Rebind keys, controller support, sensitivity settings.

# Heads-Up Display (HUD)

The HUD will provide players with critical real-time information without overwhelming them, keeping the screen uncluttered to maintain focus on the game’s puzzles and stealth elements.

## For the 3D Player:
- Mini-map: Displays the environment layout, objectives, and guard positions (if detected by the 2D player).
- Health Bar: Shows current health status.
- Objective Indicator: Highlights current mission tasks.
- Guard Alert Status: Visual indicator of how aware guards are of the player’s presence.
- Timer: Displays remaining time for time-limited objectives or speedrun attempts.

## For the 2D Player:
- Grid Overview: A map of the digital space with key points of interest (data nodes, obstacles, objectives).
- System Status: Shows the current state of the security systems (e.g., unlocked doors, disabled cameras).
- Puzzle Progress: Tracks completion of multi-step puzzles in the digital world.
- Guard Interaction Status: Indicates if the 3D player is in danger or has triggered an alert.
- Timer: A shared countdown timer with the 3D player to highlight time-based challenges.

# Inventory and Management Systems

The game will not have a traditional inventory system since the focus is on puzzle-solving and stealth mechanics rather than item collection. However, there will be a Management System for tools and abilities that both players can access and manage in their respective environments.

## 3D Player Tools:
- Keycards or Access Devices: Used to unlock doors, disable alarms, or hack into terminals in the physical world.
- Distraction Tools: Limited-use items like noise generators to lure guards away from key positions.

## 2D Player Tools:
- Hackable Systems: The 2D player will interact with security cameras, firewalls, and digital locks. As puzzles are solved, they can disable systems that affect the physical environment.
- Power-Ups or Boosts: Limited-use hacks that can speed up the progress of puzzles or temporarily disable security for the 3D player.

## Tool Management UI:
The tool management UI will appear as a minimal, retractable menu on the side of the screen. This allows quick access without interrupting the flow of gameplay.

# Player Interactions

Cooperation is the foundation of the game’s mechanics, and the UI must enable smooth communication and interaction between both players.

## For Co-op Play:
- Ping System: Both players can "ping" objects in their respective worlds (e.g., the 3D player can mark guards, and the 2D player can highlight key systems) to draw attention.
- Contextual Prompts: Dynamic prompts will appear for interactions based on proximity (e.g., "Hack this terminal" for the 3D player, or "Disable firewall" for the 2D player).
- Real-time Communication: Optional voice chat and text chat system with visual indicators when the other player is speaking or issuing commands.
- Cross-world Interaction Feedback: When the 2D player interacts with the digital systems (e.g., disables a camera), visual and audio feedback will appear for the 3D player in the physical world.

## For Single-player Mode:
- AI-Assisted Gameplay: The AI will take over the role of the other player, with average puzzle-solving and stealth results.
- Switching Perspectives: In single-player mode, players can switch between the 3D and 2D perspectives manually, with a seamless transition to avoid disrupting the gameplay flow.
