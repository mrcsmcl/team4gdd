# 1. Level Introduction

**Level Name:** Vinny's House - Operator Mode

**Theme/Environment:**  
The level is set in Vinny's suburban house at night, providing a cozy but highly interactive environment. The house is moderately cluttered, with various electronic devices scattered throughout, emphasizing Vinny's technological prowess. Cameras, motion sensors, and smart appliances are all interconnected, allowing for dynamic interactions. The garage serves as the player's command center, equipped with a computer that can manipulate different systems within the house.

**Narrative Context:**  
Vinny, an expert hacker, has turned his home into a simulation field for Leo to test his stealth abilities. However, Vinny himself must manage and guide Leo through the mission while ensuring the environment remains in their favor. The player takes on the role of Vinny, using his hacking skills to control house systems, disable security measures, and provide real-time assistance to Leo. The simulation will determine whether the two are ready for an actual heist in the future.

**Size and Structure:**  
The level is structured around Vinny's ability to interact with various systems through his computer. Each area of the house presents a different challenge, requiring strategic timing and coordination between both players. The garage, where Vinny is stationed, contains his hacking setup and serves as the main hub for player actions.

# 2. Level Objectives

## Main Objective:
Assist Leo in retrieving five key items from the house without triggering alarms, getting detected, or alerting family members.

## Tab {.tabset}

### Can of Soda in the Fridge
   - **Location:** Kitchen  
   - **Challenge:** Vinny’s mother is in the kitchen preparing food. The kitchen has motion sensors, which Vinny can disable for a few seconds at a time. He must coordinate with Leo to create a safe window for grabbing the soda.
   - **Vinny’s Task:** Access the security panel through his computer and temporarily disable motion sensors.
   - **Leo’s Task:** Move stealthily into the kitchen, grab the soda, and exit without making noise.

### Vinny’s Father’s Wristwatch
   - **Location:** Living Room  
   - **Challenge:** Vinny’s father is watching TV, making it difficult for Leo to retrieve the watch from the coffee table.
   - **Vinny’s Task:** Hack the TV, causing a temporary static disruption that forces the father to check the cables, creating an opening for Leo to act or turn the TV off.
   - **Leo’s Task:** Turn of the TV and quickly grab the wristwatch while the father is distracted.

### The Little Prince Book
   - **Location:** Clara’s Room  
   - **Challenge:** Clara is reading in bed and will only leave if she needs to check the WiFi.
   - **Vinny’s Task:** Shut down the WiFi, forcing Clara to investigate the router. This temporarily removes her from the room, giving Leo access to the book.
   - **Leo’s Task:** Enter the room, retrieve the book, and leave before Clara returns.
   - **Risk:** While the WiFi is off, Vinny loses all direct communication with Leo, requiring precise pre-planning.

### USB with Confidential Files
   - **Location:** Basement  
   - **Challenge:** The basement is locked, and the key is hidden somewhere in the house. Additionally, security cameras monitor the basement entrance.
   - **Vinny’s Task:** Locate the key via the home security cameras and disable basement cameras for a limited time.
   - **Leo’s Task:** Find the key, unlock the basement, retrieve the USB, and exit without being caught.

### Vinny’s Gaming Mouse (Optional Item)
   - **Location:** Vinny’s Room  
   - **Challenge:** The room has both motion and sound sensors that trigger an alarm.
   - **Vinny’s Task:** Remotely adjust the house’s sound system to create background noise, masking Leo’s movements.
   - **Leo’s Task:** Move carefully to retrieve the gaming mouse and exit without triggering any alarms.

## Secondary Objectives:

1. **Create distractions to move family members away from key locations:**
   - Turning off the TV disrupts Vinny’s father.
   - Shutting down the WiFi makes Clara leave her room.
   - Triggering noise in the garage attracts the mother.

2. **Explore additional hacking options:**
   - Vinny can interact with the house’s automated systems, revealing alternative paths and shortcuts.
   - Optional interactions with the home computer allow for in-depth exploration of Vinny’s hacking tools.

## Defeat Conditions:
- Leo is detected by sensors or cameras.
- Leo is spotted by family members.
- At least three of the five key items are not collected.
- The WiFi is turned off for too long, leading to a mission failure due to lack of coordination.


# 3. Level Structure and Design

## Map and Layout:
- **Garage (Operator Hub):**  
  The garage is where Vinny operates his hacking setup. It’s outfitted with a computer terminal, multiple monitors displaying live security feeds, and interactive control panels for various house systems. This area acts as the central command for all remote actions.
  
- **Kitchen:**  
  Equipped with motion sensors and the fridge containing the Can of Soda. Vinny can remotely disable these sensors for a short window, allowing Leo to safely enter and exit.

- **Living Room:**  
  This room features Vinny’s father, who is watching TV. Vinny must hack the TV to generate static, creating a distraction so Leo can grab the wristwatch from the coffee table. Alternatively, Leo can use the remote control to turn off the TV directly, achieving a similar distraction effect.

- **Clara's Room:**  
  Where The Little Prince Book is located. The room’s environment is controlled by the WiFi system. Vinny can shut down the WiFi to force Clara out, giving Leo a chance to retrieve the book. Alternatively, Vinny can initiate a secondary distraction by scattering toys throughout the house, prompting Clara’s mom to call her in to clean up, thereby clearing the room.

- **Basement:**  
  A secured area monitored by cameras and sensors. Vinny accesses security cameras to locate the hidden key and disable it for a limited time, ensuring Leo can retrieve the USB with Confidential Files.

- **Vinny's Room:**  
  Contains the optional Gaming Mouse. This room is heavily guarded by both motion and sound sensors. Vinny must create a masking noise remotely to allow Leo to obtain the item undetected.

## Progression Sequence:
1. **Garage (Start):**  
   Vinny begins in the garage, familiarizing himself with the hacking interface and system statuses for all key areas.

2. **Real-Time Coordination:**  
   As Leo moves through the house, Vinny uses his computer to disable sensors, hack devices, and trigger distractions. Each successful remote action creates a window of opportunity for Leo.

3. **Branching Challenges:**  
   Each objective (Can of Soda, Wristwatch, Book, USB, and optionally the Gaming Mouse) involves a coordinated sequence where Vinny’s system manipulations directly influence Leo’s movements in the environment.

4. **Integrated Challenges:**  
   Vinny must juggle multiple tasks simultaneously—such as managing a TV hack or remote shutdown while preparing to shut down the WiFi or scatter toys—to ensure that Leo can perform his tasks seamlessly.

5. **Dynamic Response:**  
   If an alarm is triggered or a sensor picks up Leo’s movement, Vinny can attempt quick overrides. However, prolonged system downtimes (like extended WiFi outages) can compromise the mission’s overall success.
