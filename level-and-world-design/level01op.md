# 1. Level Introduction

**Level Name:** Vinny's House - Operator Mode

**Theme/Environment:**  
The level is set in Vinny's suburban house at night, providing a cozy but highly interactive environment. The house is moderately cluttered, with various electronic devices scattered throughout, emphasizing Vinny's technological prowess. Cameras, motion sensors, and smart appliances are all interconnected, allowing for dynamic interactions. The garage serves as the player's command center, equipped with a computer that can manipulate different systems within the house.

**Narrative Context:**  
Vinny, an expert hacker, has turned his home into a simulation field for Leo to test his stealth abilities. However, Vinny himself must manage and guide Leo through the mission while ensuring the environment remains in their favor. The player takes on the role of Vinny, using his hacking skills to control house systems, disable security measures, and provide real-time assistance to Leo. The simulation will determine whether the two are ready for an actual heist in the future.

**Size and Structure:**  
The level is structured around Vinny's ability to interact with various systems through his computer. Each area of the house presents a different challenge, requiring strategic timing and coordination between both players. The garage, where Vinny is stationed, contains his hacking setup and serves as the main hub for player actions.
