## Level 01

### 1. Level Introduction

**Level Name:** Home Training  
**Theme/Environment:**  
The level takes place in a typical suburban house at night, with a cozy atmosphere but filled with unexpected challenges. The house's decor is simple but hides a touch of technological improvisation due to Vinny's involvement with hacking. Motion sensors are installed, security cameras are placed at strategic points, and automated lights can change the mood of the situation. The house is slightly messy, reflecting the everyday routine of a regular family.

**Narrative Context:**  
This level serves as an introductory tutorial for the player to learn the dynamics of cooperation between Vinny (the hacker strategist) and Leo (the agile executor). After discussing a plan to steal a next-gen console from a futuristic store, Vinny suggests a practical test: turning his own house into a simulation field for Leo to prove he's up to the mission. The player takes on the role of Leo, who must move stealthily through the house while Vinny remotely guides him and creates distractions using his hacking skills. This familiar environment also reinforces the relaxed relationship between the two protagonists.

**Size and Structure:**  
The level is hybrid, allowing free exploration of the house, but with specific objectives and challenges in different rooms. The structure of the challenges guides the player through the space, while the need to create distractions opens up new strategic possibilities.

### 2. Level Objectives

**Main Objective:**  
As Leo, the player must collect five key items from the house without being detected by sensors or family members.

1. **Can of Soda in the Fridge:**  
   - **Location:** Kitchen  
   - **Challenge:** Vinny's mother is preparing food. The kitchen has motion sensors that Vinny can disable for short periods. The player will need to coordinate timing to open the fridge and grab the can.

2. **Vinny's Father's Clock:**  
   - **Location:** Living room coffee table  
   - **Challenge:** Vinny's father is in the living room watching TV. The player will need to have Vinny hack the TV, temporarily turning it off, which will force the father to check the situation, granting access to the clock.

3. **The Little Prince Book:**  
   - **Location:** Clara's room (Vinny's younger sister)  
   - **Challenge:** Clara will be reading the book in bed. The player will need to create a distraction, like turning off the WiFi, to make her leave the room and talk to their parents, who will check the router. This will open a window to grab the book without being noticed.

4. **USB with Confidential Files:**  
   - **Location:** Basement  
   - **Challenge:** The basement is locked, and the key is hidden somewhere in the house (with a random location). After finding the key, the player will need to avoid sensors and cameras in the basement to access the table where the USB is stored.

5. **Vinny's Gaming Mouse (Optional Item):**  
   - **Location:** Vinny's room  
   - **Challenge:** Vinny's room is equipped with sound and motion sensors, so any misstep will trigger the alarm. This item is optional but challenges the player to use advanced stealth skills.

---

**Secondary Objectives:**

1. Create distractions to move family members away and make it easier to collect the items:
   - Turn off the TV in the living room: Forces Vinny's father to leave temporarily to check the issue.
   - Turn off the WiFi: Makes Clara leave her room to check the router, clearing the way to grab the book.
   - Make noise in the garage: Attracts the mother to the garage, making areas like the kitchen and living room less guarded.

2. Explore additional interactions around the house, like finding hints and extra conversations between Vinny and Leo that explain the larger plan.

---

**Defeat Condition:**  
The player will fail the level if:
- Leo is detected by cameras or sensors: Some areas have direct surveillance, which Vinny can disable temporarily, but mistakes cost the mission. Some cameras, even with access, Vinny cannot disable.
- Leo is seen by family members: Any direct eye contact with the father, mother, or Clara results in failure.
- Leo does not collect at least three main items: The soda can, the clock, and The Little Prince book.

### 3. Level Structure and Design

**Map and Layout:**  
The level is divided into several interconnected areas within the house, with alternative paths and points of interest.

  - Where Vinny's father is watching TV.  
  - A clock is on the coffee table. The path to this area passes through a monitored corridor.

  - Motion sensors are installed near the door.

- **Clara's Room:**  
  - Clara is lying in bed reading The Little Prince book.

- **Vinny's Room:**  
  - Equipped with computers, LEDs, and sensors. Contains the optional gaming mouse.

- **Basement:**  
  - A dark and messy space with sensors and cameras, where the USB is hidden.

**Progression Sequence:**  
1. **Garage (Start):**  
   - The player learns basic movement and interaction controls while Vinny explains the plan through the headset.
   
2. **Living Room:**  
   - The first stealth challenge: grab the clock without alerting the father.

3. **Kitchen:**  
   - Temporarily disable sensors and coordinate opening the fridge.

4. **Clara's Room:**  
   - Create a distraction to grab the book.

5. **Vinny's Room:**  
   - Avoid sensors and find the gaming mouse.

6. **Basement:**  
   - Use the key to enter, avoid cameras, and grab the USB.

**Exploration and Secrets:**  
- **Secret Area:** A hidden panel in the garage conceals lore items, like Vinny's diary with ideas for future hacks.  
- **Easter Egg:** In Clara's room, interacting with the plush rabbit plays a nostalgic song and triggers a funny dialogue between Vinny and Leo.  
- **Collectibles:** Childhood photographs of Vinny scattered around the house, unlocking details about the friendship with Leo.

### 4. Walkthrough (Step-by-Step)

**Entering the Level:**  
The player begins in the garage. Vinny introduces the objective: practice stealth and collect five key items without alerting the family. The player learns to move, create basic distractions, and hide.

**Main Events:**  
1. **Living Room:**  
   - **Event:** Vinny turns off the TV to distract the father, who will talk to the mother if she turned it off, and then return to look for the remote. The player needs to act quickly to grab the clock.  
   - **Alternative Event:** Leo acquires the TV remote and turns it off to distract the father.

2. **Clara's Room:**  
   - **Event:** When the WiFi is turned off, Clara leaves the room complaining, and Vinny responds with sarcastic comments about how people rely on the internet.  
   - **Alternative Event:** Taking Clara's toys and throwing them around the house will cause the mother or father to call Clara to clean up, leading to her grumbling that it wasn’t her fault.

3. **Basement:**  
   - **Event:** The player accidentally triggers an alarm when grabbing the USB, and Vinny needs to hack the system to disable it, adding a tension element.

**Problem Solving:**  
- **Motion Sensors:**  
  - Temporarily deactivated by Vinny, requiring precise coordination from the player.

- **Distractions:**  
  - Create noise in the garage or turn off the WiFi to move family members away from important areas.

- **Cameras:**  
  - The player needs to identify movement patterns and proceed at the right moment.

**Exiting the Level:**  
After collecting all the necessary items, the player must return to the garage without being detected. Vinny creates a final distraction (cuts the power to the house for 10 seconds), allowing Leo to move quickly. The level ends with Vinny praising Leo but mentioning that the next real mission will be much harder.
