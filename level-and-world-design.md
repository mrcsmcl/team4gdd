# Level Structure

Each level presents distinct challenges that require close cooperation between the 2D and 3D players, introducing new mechanics, tools, and environmental obstacles as players progress. The levels are structured to gradually increase in difficulty, complexity, and narrative tension.

### Prototype

- Level 1: Serves as an introductory level where players become familiar with basic mechanics, such as movement, communication, and simple obstacle navigation. The 3D player learns stealth basics and physical interaction with doors or switches, while the 2D player experiments with suggesting directions and initial hacking attempts.

- Level 2: Introduces more interactive systems, like security cameras and basic firewalls, to help players understand the importance of timing and communication. Both players encounter their first puzzle, involving a combination of button presses and camera coordination to navigate a controlled area.

- Level 3: Increases complexity by adding NPCs and defensive security systems. Players must work together to navigate more challenging obstacles, such as doors controlled from separate areas, timed locks, and coordinated movements to bypass guards.

- Level 4 and Beyond: Each level continues to build upon the previous ones, adding new mechanics (e.g., adaptive firewalls, multi-screen hacking for the 2D player) and higher-stakes puzzles, such as locating and unlocking alternative exits or triggering distractions to advance through heavily secured areas.

# Layout and Flow

Each level is designed to promote continuous movement and cooperation, with players alternating between moments of intense action and strategic planning.

- Choke Points and Checkpoints: The levels include choke points that require players to solve a series of puzzles or avoid detection to proceed. These areas demand high coordination and are designed to encourage exploration of different strategies. Checkpoints are placed at key points to provide moments of respite and an opportunity to reset after mistakes, while also reinforcing the pacing.

- Branching Paths: Levels often feature branching paths that allow players to choose their approach based on available tools or personal preferences. For example, the 3D player may choose to sneak through a vent system, while the 2D player disables surrounding cameras to create a safe path. These options support replayability and give players a sense of agency.

- Verticality and Multi-Level Flow: The 3D environments incorporate vertical elements, such as staircases, elevators, and multiple floors, which the 3D player must navigate. This layout complexity offers advantages, such as better positioning to evade guards and providing varied sightlines. The 2D player aids in this by controlling elevators or disabling locks across different floors.

# Puzzles and Missions

Each level contains specific puzzles and mission objectives that vary in complexity and challenge players to work together.

- Basic Puzzles: Simple switches, buttons, and sequential doors that introduce players to the cooperative nature of the game. For example, the 3D player may find a locked door that only the 2D player can unlock by solving a pattern-based puzzle.

- Intermediate Puzzles: Multi-step puzzles that require both players to be actively involved. For example, the 2D player might need to disable an adaptive firewall while the 3D player sneaks past nearby guards. Timed sequences, where the 2D player must solve a puzzle to unlock a door before the 3D player is spotted, add to the challenge.

- Advanced Puzzles and Missions: Complex tasks involving multiple systems, such as hacking a set of doors while simultaneously managing power surges or counteracting security bots. Missions at these levels can include “distract-and-escape” scenarios, where the 2D player creates diversions to lure guards away while the 3D player sneaks into restricted areas.

- Special Missions: Certain levels introduce unique, time-sensitive missions, such as reaching extraction points before a security lockdown occurs or escorting a “data packet” (represented by the 2D player) to a designated point without detection. These missions require exceptional coordination and can serve as climactic points in the storyline.

# Environments

The game’s levels are set in a variety of environments within a futuristic corporate complex, each offering a distinct atmosphere and visual identity.

- Corporate Offices: Sleek, high-tech office spaces with glass walls, metallic furniture, and ambient lighting. These areas are patrolled by guards and monitored by numerous security cameras, requiring the 3D player to move carefully while relying on the 2D player for camera feed assistance.

- Server Rooms: Darker areas filled with rows of computer servers and dim lighting. These rooms often contain critical systems that the 2D player must access and protect from counter-hacking measures. They feature tight spaces that create both opportunities and risks for the 3D player to hide from patrolling NPCs.

- Control Rooms: High-security rooms with restricted access. Control rooms feature multiple terminals and screens that provide the 2D player with valuable intel but are heavily guarded. These areas also include emergency power systems that can temporarily disable doors or cameras.

- Maintenance Tunnels and Vents: Narrow pathways and hidden routes that allow the 3D player to bypass highly secure sections. These areas are dimly lit and isolated but may contain unexpected obstacles, like motion sensors or patrolling drones, that only the 2D player can disable.

- Labs and Research Facilities: Environments with experimental technology, glowing holograms, and unique obstacles, such as automated laser grids that the 2D player must deactivate. These spaces contain valuable information, such as blueprints and security plans, adding to the narrative depth.

- Extraction Zones: The final point in each level, representing the characters’ escape goal. Extraction zones are secured areas often surrounded by security guards and defense systems. In the final moments, the players must coordinate quickly to bypass heightened security measures and reach the extraction point together.
