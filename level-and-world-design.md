The design philosophy of the game focuses on creating a **highly immersive world** that emphasizes player cooperation, exploration, and problem-solving. Levels are built around the central mechanic of dual gameplay, blending **stealth**, **hacking**, and **teamwork**. Each environment is crafted to support both characters' abilities, ensuring dynamic interactions between the physical and digital worlds.

## Level Structure

1. **Campaign-Based Progression**  
   - The game is divided into a series of **missions** tied to the overarching narrative.  
   - Each mission introduces new challenges, mechanics, and environments to keep gameplay fresh.  
   - Levels gradually increase in complexity:
     - Early levels serve as **tutorials**, introducing players to core mechanics.
     - Mid-levels feature **multi-layered objectives** that require players to strategize.
     - Final levels push players to master the mechanics with time-critical tasks and advanced threats.

2. **Hub System**  
   - Between missions, players can access a central **safehouse hub**:
     - Upgrade gear and tools for Leo and Vinny.
     - Replay previously completed missions to attempt optional objectives.
     - View narrative progression through collectibles and lore.

## **Layout and Flow**

1. **Branching Design with Linear Objectives**  
   - Levels are designed with **multiple paths**, allowing players to choose their approach:
     - **Leo’s Path (Physical):** Focused on stealth, climbing, and infiltration.
     - **Vinny’s Path (Digital):** Focused on hacking systems and manipulating the environment.  
   - Despite multiple paths, objectives are structured linearly to guide players towards key story beats.

2. **Synchronized Gameplay Flow**  
   - Levels are built around **key synchronization points** where Leo and Vinny’s actions intersect:
     - Example: Vinny disables a laser grid just as Leo reaches the area.  
   - **Dynamic Flow:** The pace alternates between tense stealth moments, puzzle-solving, and fast-paced escapes.

3. **Checkpoint System**  
   - Frequent checkpoints allow players to retry challenging sections without losing significant progress.  
   - Checkpoints are often placed after major objectives or puzzles.

## **Puzzles and Missions**

1. **Integrated Puzzle Design**  
   - Puzzles are seamlessly embedded into the environment, requiring teamwork to solve:
     - **Leo’s Role:** Manipulating physical objects (e.g., moving crates, activating switches).  
     - **Vinny’s Role:** Hacking systems to unlock doors, disable traps, or reroute energy.  

2. **Mission Types**  
   - **Infiltration Missions:** Break into high-security facilities to steal data or sabotage operations.  
   - **Extraction Missions:** Rescue allies or retrieve critical assets while avoiding detection.  
   - **Sabotage Missions:** Disrupt operations by planting viruses or triggering system failures.  

3. **Dynamic Objectives**  
   - Missions feature both primary and secondary objectives:
     - **Primary:** Required to complete the level and advance the story.  
     - **Secondary:** Optional goals that unlock bonuses, like upgrades or cosmetics.  

4. **Timed Events**  
   - Certain missions introduce time-sensitive tasks to increase tension:
     - Example: Disabling an alarm system before reinforcements arrive.

## **Environments**

1. **Thematic Diversity**  
   - Each level is set in a unique location tied to the story’s progression, creating variety in visuals and gameplay challenges:
     - **Corporate Skyscrapers:** High-tech offices with cameras, laser grids, and pressure-sensitive floors.  
     - **Underground Data Centers:** Dark, claustrophobic spaces filled with server racks and moving drones.  
     - **Luxury Estates:** Lavishly designed interiors with hidden security measures and intricate layouts.  
     - **Urban Streets:** Open areas with patrolling guards, security bots, and environmental hazards.  

2. **Environmental Storytelling**  
   - Environments are filled with **clues and details** that expand the game’s lore:
     - Corporate documents, emails, and visual cues hint at the antagonist's plans.  
     - Players can uncover the history of each location through exploration.  

3. **Interactive World Elements**  
   - The environment is highly interactive, encouraging experimentation:
     - **Leo:** Can disable security cameras, sabotage guard patrols, or create distractions.  
     - **Vinny:** Can manipulate lighting, disable alarms, or trigger traps to assist Leo.  

4. **Dynamic Elements**  
   - Environments react to player actions:
     - Triggering alarms leads to increased patrols or locked exits.  
     - Destroying specific systems may cause power outages, opening new paths but adding risk.

5. **Atmospheric Design**  
   - Environments are designed to evoke a specific mood:
     - **Tense and Foreboding:** Dimly lit corridors and echoing sounds in data centers.  
     - **Opulent and Deceptive:** Bright, polished surfaces hiding traps in luxury estates.  
     - **High-Tech and Chaotic:** Buzzing lights, holograms, and constant drone movement in skyscrapers.

### **Example Level Flow: Corporate Data Breach**

1. **Entry Point (Introduction)**  
   - Leo infiltrates a building through the loading dock while Vinny hacks into the building’s mainframe to disable cameras.

2. **Midpoint (Teamwork Challenge)**  
   - Vinny must solve a multi-layered puzzle to unlock a door while Leo holds off patrolling guards using distractions.

3. **Climactic Moment (High Stakes)**  
   - An alarm is triggered, forcing Leo to navigate a laser grid while Vinny reroutes power to open the final exit.

4. **Exit (Resolution)**  
   - Both players must coordinate to escape while avoiding newly deployed security bots.
