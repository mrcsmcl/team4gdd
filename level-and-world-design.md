# Level Structure

Split into two planes: 3D physical world and 2D digital world. The players interact with both simultaneously, solving puzzles that overlap and influence each other's environments.

# Layout and Flow

- 3D player moves through stealth-oriented levels, avoiding AI guards and interacting with environmental obstacles.
- 2D player navigates the mainframe, solving platformer-like puzzles to disable systems and unlock doors for the 3D player.

# Puzzles and Missions

- Co-op puzzles that require both players to complete tasks simultaneously or in sync.
- Mission progression is tied to freeing the 2D player from the digital traps set by the megacorporation.
