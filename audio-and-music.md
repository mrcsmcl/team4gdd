# Audio Design

The audio design for the game focuses on immersion, tension, and collaboration. Each audio element is crafted to enhance the atmosphere, inform gameplay, and emphasize the co-op dynamic. From the stealthy footsteps of the 3D player to the mechanical hums of security systems and the minimalist tones of the hacker interface, every sound plays a critical role in building an engaging experience.

## Soundtrack

### Overview
- The soundtrack blends **ambient electronic music** with **tension-building orchestration**, reflecting the game's stealth and futuristic themes.
- Dynamic music adapts to gameplay, intensifying during critical moments, such as evading detection or solving cooperative puzzles.

### Musical Style
- **Ambient Layers:** Slow, evolving pads and synthetic textures set the mood in quieter moments.  
- **Rhythmic Pulses:** Subtle beats and percussive elements drive the tension during stealth sequences.  
- **High-Stakes Tracks:** Faster tempos, distorted basslines, and sharp synth stabs accompany chase or combat scenarios.  
- **Minimalistic Hacker Themes:** Calmer, looping tracks with glitch-inspired effects for the 2D interface, creating a contrast with the tense 3D environment.  

### Inspirations
- Soundtracks from games like *Mirror's Edge*, *Deus Ex*, and *Superhot*.  
- Artists like *Trent Reznor*, *Hans Zimmer*, and *Deadmau5*.
