# Soundtrack

Music that shifts dynamically between stealth suspense and cyberpunk hacking vibes. The music could change depending on the playerâ€™s actions (e.g., discovery by guards ramps up tension).

# Sound Effects

- For the 3D player: Footsteps, environmental sounds, guard chatter, and alarms.
- For the 2D player: Digital sounds, beeps, and feedback for interacting with the mainframe.

# Voiceovers
