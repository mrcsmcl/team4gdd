# Chapter 01

## Scene 1 - The Garage Conversation

**Int. Suburban House Garage – Night**  
A simple space, cluttered with tech: old monitors, disassembled computer parts, tangled cables. **VINNY** (nerdy, early twenties, with intense, restless eyes) is working on an old Linux terminal, while **LEO** (twenty-one, athletic, always with headphones) paces back and forth, holding a controller in his hands.

> **LEO**  
> *(impatient)*  
> Dude, have you seen the **NEXUS 9000**? It’s the dream console! Immersive graphics, AI that learns from the player, an infinite library. It’s everywhere.

> **VINNY**  
> *(sarcastic)*  
> And with a price tag only the rich can afford, right? Just looking at the ad makes my wallet hurt.

> **LEO**  
> *(laughing)*  
> Yeah, I know... And you know I can’t afford even a fraction of that. I barely managed to pay for my last headset upgrade. *(pause, eyes lighting up)* What if... we just got one, you know?

> **VINNY**  
> *(raising an eyebrow, intrigued)*  
> Got one? What do you mean, “got one”? This is a console, not some two-dollar game on sale.

> **LEO**  
> *(lowering his voice, more serious)*  
> We can do it, Vinny. Look, I’ve been to that store like ten times. I know the layout. What if we did a test run first? Like… simulate it here at your place to see if we can actually pull it off.

> **VINNY**  
> *(surprised but interested)*  
> You’re serious, huh? A simulation... here?

> **LEO**  
> *(nodding, smiling)*  
> Exactly! You’ll be in control, monitoring everything from the terminal. It’s just a training run, no risk... but if we make it through, that **NEXUS 9000** store is our next target.

## Scene 2 - Preparing for the Run

**Int. Garage – Night**  
**VINNY** gets up from his chair, looking around the cluttered garage thoughtfully. **LEO** watches, excited, already mentally ready for action.

> **VINNY**  
> *(thoughtful)*  
> Okay, let’s say I’m in. How do you plan to turn my place into a “high-tech console store”?

> **LEO**  
> *(grinning)*  
> Easy! *(glances around, pointing at cameras and monitors)* You already have most of what we need right here. I’ll come in through the garage, and you control the cameras and guide me. If I can get past the “security system” without getting caught… then I think we’re ready for the next level.

> **VINNY**  
> *(chuckling)*  
> So the idea is you’re the “thief” and I’m the hacker on standby?

> **LEO**  
> *(nodding confidently)*  
> Exactly! You’ll monitor, redirect cameras, disable alarms… like in real-time. And I’ll do the “physical” work, you know, what I’m good at.

> **VINNY**  
> *(sighing, smiling)*  
> Alright, you convinced me. Let’s see if your plan holds up. I’ll set up the system here. But if it fails, that’s on you.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, confident)*  
> If I fail, I swear I’ll pay for your next system upgrade. But hey, that’s not happening!

**Int. Control Room – Minutes later**  
**VINNY**’s computer screen now displays multiple windows, code scrolling on the terminal, cameras connected, each one showing a different angle of the house. He adjusts the system, creating virtual barriers and simulated “blind spots.”

**LEO** dons a black hoodie and takes position by the garage door, waiting for **VINNY**’s signal.

> **VINNY**  
> *(speaking through the headset)*  
> All set. Go ahead, “thief,” show me what you’ve got.

> **LEO**  
> *(whispering, stepping out of the garage)*  
> That console is as good as ours.

**VINNY** watches the cameras closely, guiding LEO through the space, dodging simulated sensors, moving the cameras via terminal commands. **LEO** moves carefully, crouching, making his way through each corner as if in a real store.

## Scene 3 - The Return to the Garage

**Int. Garage – Moments later**  
**LEO** walks back into the garage, laughing and out of breath, a satisfied glint in his eyes. **VINNY** waits by the monitor, arms crossed, unable to hide his grin.

> **LEO**  
> *(smiling, excited)*  
> That was awesome! I got past all the “traps” you set up. And you managing the cameras? Felt like something straight out of a movie.

> **VINNY**  
> *(feigning modesty)*  
> It wasn’t that hard. But I gotta admit... you did well. *(pauses, thinking)* If this was just a test, I think we’re ready for something bigger.

> **LEO**  
> *(playfully punching Vinny’s shoulder, pumped up)*  
> Then it’s settled. Our next target: a real store. And this time, we’re walking out with a NEXUS 9000!

> **VINNY**  
> *(looking at the terminal, thoughtful yet excited)*  
> Let’s get to planning, then. We’ll need details... and a lot of patience.
