# Art Style
<br>

The game’s art style embraces a clean, futuristic aesthetic with smooth surfaces, sharp lines, and a streamlined design. This world is filled with polished metals, soft glows, and minimalist architecture that reflects a high-tech facility built for function and security. The colors lean toward cool tones, with a palette of whites, grays, and blues, accented by subtle, strategically placed neon lights. The environments and assets are designed to feel sterile and efficient, conveying the sense of a meticulously controlled and organized space.

## Key Features

- Minimalism: Focused on simplicity and function, with very little clutter or unnecessary detailing.
- Cool Color Palette: Whites, silvers, and blues dominate, with occasional warm accents for emphasis on important objects or UI elements.
- Glowing Elements: Small lights and panels glow gently, indicating interactive or essential elements. These effects are kept subtle to maintain a sleek look.
- Polished Surfaces: Most surfaces are smooth, reflective, and pristine, giving the setting a clinical, futuristic feel.

# 3D Models or 2D Sprites

Since the game involves both 2D and 3D modes, the art direction for each player’s perspective will vary slightly to fit their respective views while maintaining consistency in the overall design.

## 3D Models (for the 3D Player)

- Character Models: The 3D player is represented with a detailed but sleek model. The character’s design emphasizes utility, with a lightweight, futuristic suit featuring glowing accents that indicate stealth modes and health status.
- Guards and NPCs: Enemy NPCs, such as guards, are designed with streamlined armor that blends into the facility’s design, making them appear as extensions of the building's security. Their movement is precise, and they feature visors or helmets with small glowing indicators for easy identification.
- Facility Objects: Doors, consoles, and terminals have a smooth, functional look. These objects include slight glows or animations when interacted with, providing visual feedback without disrupting the aesthetic.

## 2D Sprites (for the 2D Player)

- Player Interface: The 2D player’s screen has a simplified representation of the facility, showing layouts, doors, and systems as clean lines and icons. Minimalist icons are used for various controls, like doors, cameras, and communications.
- Hacking Elements: Puzzles and hacking interfaces resemble circuit boards and abstract puzzles. They are designed with clean lines, connecting points, and glowing elements that react to player inputs, visually indicating successful hacks or locked systems.
- NPC Icons: Enemy NPCs are represented by simple icons on the 2D map that show direction and movement. When intercepted, communication lines are represented by small flashing icons to keep the 2D player aware of enemy positions.

# Environments
<br>

Each environment in the facility is carefully crafted to enhance the feeling of a high-security, futuristic building. Spaces are clean, with minimal decoration, creating a stark, high-tech atmosphere.

## Facility Areas

- Corporate Offices: These are well-lit, spacious rooms with large glass windows and minimalist furniture. The offices have a cold, impersonal feel, with workstations organized in precise rows and little personal decoration. Touch panels and holographic displays are used throughout for navigation and access.
- Server Rooms: Darker, cooler environments filled with rows of LED-lit server racks. These rooms are intended to feel dense and maze-like, with narrow pathways between server banks and subtle environmental sounds (like humming servers) to build tension.
- Security Halls and Corridors: Narrower, dimly lit areas with minimal features. The walls are polished metal with reflective surfaces, allowing players to see subtle glints of movement or light. Small ceiling cameras and motion sensors subtly alert the player to monitored areas.
- Control Rooms: High-tech rooms with multiple display panels and large touchscreens, showing live data from around the facility. The walls have sleek control consoles with glow indicators, and these rooms serve as hubs for the 2D player’s interface.
- Maintenance Tunnels: These tight, confined spaces offer the 3D player hidden pathways to avoid detection. With exposed metal pipes, faint lighting, and grated floors, these tunnels feel starkly utilitarian, emphasizing the futuristic but unembellished design.

# Visual Effects

Visual effects in the game are designed to enhance the gameplay without overwhelming the futuristic aesthetic. Effects are kept subtle, reinforcing the polished, controlled nature of the environment.

## Core Effects

- Light Glows and Reflections: Interactive elements, like control panels and doors, emit a soft glow to guide players. Reflective surfaces are carefully used to create depth and emphasize the sterile environment.
- Hacking Effects: When the 2D player initiates a hack, the affected systems show a brief visual effect, like a wave or ripple, to indicate successful interaction. Puzzle-solving screens have animations that feel like smooth electrical pulses.
- Security Systems: Firewalls, if triggered, create a visual barrier on the 2D screen, simulating interference with a digital “glitch” effect. Camera feeds may temporarily scramble if the security system detects a hack attempt, adding to the tension.
- Stealth Indicators: For the 3D player, visual indicators appear when they enter a guard’s line of sight or step into a monitored area. These indicators are subtle, like a slight glow around the screen’s edge, to warn players without breaking immersion.
- Environmental Sounds: Although not a visual effect, environmental audio cues (like the hum of machinery or subtle alarms) are integrated to complement the visual design, enhancing immersion in the futuristic environment.
