# Art Style
<br>

The art style for the game combines futuristic realism with a narrative-driven aesthetic. Each environment reflects the setting's purpose and tone, ensuring the visual design aligns with the story's progression and gameplay elements. The game’s art style focuses on creating immersive, realistic environments while maintaining a minimalistic and sleek look for interfaces and interactive elements.

## Environment Design

### General Aesthetic
- **Realistic Futurism:**  
  Environments should feel grounded in the near future (5-10 years ahead). Architecture and objects will feature sleek lines, advanced materials, and subtle technological advancements while maintaining a sense of familiarity.  
  A focus on clean, polished surfaces, with occasional imperfections to avoid sterility.  

- **Lighting:**  
  Lighting will play a crucial role in setting the mood. Dim, soft lighting will dominate tense areas, with brighter lights highlighting important pathways or interactive objects. Neon accents and holographic displays will enhance the futuristic feel.
