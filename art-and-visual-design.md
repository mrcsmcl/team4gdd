## 3D Player's World

The 3D world is designed with a sleek, modern-futuristic aesthetic that feels advanced yet grounded. Buildings and structures emphasize smooth lines and minimalist, geometric designs, creating an organized and high-tech environment. The world is brightly illuminated with cool, diffused lighting, giving a sense of cleanliness and order. Surfaces are primarily metallic with glass and polished concrete elements, while occasional touches of blue or white LED lighting accentuate the futuristic look.

- Lighting: Soft white and blue lights are used to illuminate hallways, doors, and control panels. The lighting is indirect but purposeful, with well-defined shadows that add depth without overwhelming the minimalist look.

- Textures: Predominantly smooth and reflective surfaces, with matte concrete, brushed metal, and glass finishes that enhance the sterile, high-tech ambiance.

- Color Scheme: A focus on whites, silvers, and grays with subtle blue accents to highlight technology and key objects, maintaining a polished, streamlined look.


## 2D Player's World

The 2D world is stylized and digital, representing a virtual network within the mainframe. It consists of clean, grid-like patterns and abstract forms, evoking a sense of navigating through a controlled, artificial environment. This world features vibrant, glowing colors on a dark background, creating a high-contrast look that distinguishes elements like firewalls, nodes, and pathways.

- Visual Design: Geometric shapes and neon-colored lines represent data pathways and obstacles. Icons and symbols simplify complex systems, making it clear which areas are accessible and which are locked.

- Color Scheme: High-contrast colors, such as neon blues, greens, and purples, against a deep, dark background, emphasizing a digital and abstract feel.

- Transitions: Subtle pulses or shifts in color intensity highlight system interactions or responses to player actions, adding a dynamic feel to an otherwise static grid.


# 3D Models or 2D Sprites

3D Models: The 3D player, guards, and other NPCs are high-definition models with a futuristic look. The 3D player model features streamlined, utilitarian clothing, with subtle tech accessories that fit the setting. Environmental objects, such as doors, consoles, and security cameras, are designed with a minimalist, high-tech appearance. Decorative elements are limited, focusing on functionality and clean lines.

2D Sprites: The 2D world relies on simplified sprites that reflect different system elements. Firewalls, nodes, and data pathways appear as colorful, pulsing shapes. Each sprite is distinct yet minimalist, using geometric forms to ensure clarity. Small animations, such as pulsing colors or glitch effects, help add life to this virtual environment.

# Environments
<br>

## 3D Player's Environment

The 3D environment represents the physical world that the player navigates, filled with security obstacles and modernist architectural design. Each level is set within a corporate building, with zones that might include high-security hallways, server rooms, and control centers. The setting emphasizes function over form, with rooms and hallways free from unnecessary decoration.

### Key Environmental Features:
- Secure Doors: Mechanized, with sleek panels and subtle light indicators showing locked/unlocked states.
- Surveillance: Mounted cameras that track the player’s movements, with red or blue indicator lights signaling active status.
- Hiding Spots: Limited nooks, like darkened alcoves or storage areas, where the player can evade detection.
- Spatial Layout: Designed to guide the player through specific stealth and puzzle areas, with minimal clutter. A clear path is often visible, but obstacles, like guards or locked doors, require strategic maneuvering.

## 2D Player's Environment

The 2D environment mimics a network system interface, representing a schematic layout of the corporate building’s digital infrastructure. It’s a segmented, maze-like structure where each node or pathway signifies data connections or access points that the player must navigate.

### Key Environmental Features:

- Firewalls: Act as barriers that the player must bypass or disable through puzzles. These appear as bold, pulsing red walls or lines.
- Nodes: Represent various system points, like cameras, doors, or alarm systems. Each node has a unique color or shape to differentiate its function.
- Data Pathways: Neon lines connecting nodes, representing routes the player can access. Some pathways are temporarily disabled or require unlocking.
- Visual Cues: Icons or color changes signify interactable elements. For instance, unlocked nodes glow brightly, while locked nodes are dimmed or grayed out.

# Visual Effects

## 3D World Effects:

- Lighting Effects: Soft ambient lighting with occasional light flares near screens or security doors. Reflective surfaces cast subtle light reflections, enhancing realism.
- Surveillance Indicators: When security cameras detect movement, subtle red beams or flashing lights appear, visually signaling alert status.
- Hacking Animations: When the 3D player interacts with control panels, short animations (like digital code sequences or brief screen flickers) show successful or failed attempts.

## 2D World Effects:
- Firewall Effects: When the 2D player bypasses a firewall, glitch-like animations briefly appear, showing the wall breaking down digitally.
- Node Activation: Nodes pulse or emit a glow when activated. If a node controls cameras or other systems, lines connecting to those elements light up, representing established control.
- Warning Alerts: When the 3D player is in danger (e.g., near a guard), the 2D screen may display flashing indicators or a visual overlay alerting the 2D player to potential threats.
