# Player Character

The 3D Player is a stealth-focused character who must avoid AI guards and interact with objects to help the 2D player progress.

# Non-Player Characters (NPCs)

AI Guards will patrol the 3D environments, applying pressure on the 3D player to act carefully and quickly.

# AI Behavior

- Guards follow preset patrol paths but can react dynamically to the playerâ€™s actions (e.g., alarms triggered by mistakes).
- For the 2D player, the digital world might have its own "guard" system, like firewalls or malware acting as obstacles.
